# Deprecated

We have deprecated the legacy Oso open source library. We have plans for the next open source release and we’re looking forward to getting feedback from the community leading up to that point (please reach out to us in the Slack #help channel). In the meantime, if you’re happy using the Oso open source library now, nothing needs to change – i.e., we are not end-of-lifing (EOL) the library and we’ll continue to provide support and critical bug fixes.

# Oso go library

This is the publish repository for the oso go library. It contains prebuilt oso-core
libraries so that you can reference this module directly in go code.

All development happens on https://github.com/osohq/oso.

`go get github.com/osohq/go-oso`

```
    import "github.com/osohq/go-oso"
    ...
```
