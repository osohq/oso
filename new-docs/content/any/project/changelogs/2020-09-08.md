## `oso` 0.5.2

### New features

#### Support for constructors with both positional and keyword arguments ([#405](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/405))


* In languages that support both positional and keyword arguments (currently
Python and Ruby), Oso now supports registering classes with constructors that
use both.


* The syntax for calling a constructor with mixed arguments from an Oso policy is:

```
new MyClass(1, 2, foo: 3)
```


* As with Python and Ruby, positional arguments must come before keyword
arguments.


* For more, see documentation for the new operator.

### Other bugs & improvements


* The Node.js library will now throw an `InvalidConstructorError` when
attempting to register a non-constructable object via `registerClass`.
([#392](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/392))


* Rule indexing performance improvements. ([#409](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/409))


* Standardize handling of ±∞ and NaN across all language libraries. ([#410](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/410))


* Better warnings for unknown specializers that are similar to built-in types.
([#403](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/403))


* Fix an issue with `readline`’s calculation of the cursor position in the Python
REPL on Linux. ([#397](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/397))

## `django-oso` 0.1.0 ([#395](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/395))
