## `oso` 0.9.0

### Breaking changes

**WARNING**: This release contains breaking changes. Be sure
to follow migration steps before upgrading.

#### Removed “extras”

The Oso library previously had some additional default supported classes:
`Http` and `Pathmapper`. These have been deprecated and removed.

To write policies over HTTP requests, either register the suitable application
class directly, or use a framework integration (e.g. `flask-oso` or
`django-oso`) which will do this for you automatically.

### New features

#### `PolarClass` implemented for `uuid` crate

`PolarClass` is now implemented for [version 0.6 of the `uuid` crate](https://docs.rs/uuid/0.6/uuid/) behind the optional `uuid-06` feature
flag. Version 0.6 was chosen for compatibility with [Diesel](https://crates.io/crates/diesel).

Thanks to [John Halbert](https://github.com/johnhalbert) for the
contribution!

### Other bugs & improvements


* Fixed bug where checking if a character is in a string would fail incorrectly.

## `django-oso` 0.5.0

### Other bugs & improvements


* The Django `AnonymousUser` class is available in polar policies under the
name `auth::AnonymousUser`. This name is preferable to the previous fully
qualified name because it matches the registered name of the `User` model
(`auth::User`).


* The `django-oso` library no longer prints to stdout when loading policy
files. Instead, the Python `logging` module is used.


* Relaxed the requirements for the Python `oso` and `django-oso` libraries.
These now require `cffi~=1.14` and `django>=2.2`, respectively.

Thanks to [Mike D.](https://github.com/devmonkey22) for suggesting /
implementing the above three improvements!


* The Django list filtering adapter now fully supports use of the `not`
operator in policies.


* For the Django list filtering adapter, a rule like `allow(_, _, post: Post)
if _tag in post.tags;` now translates into a constraint that the post must
have at least 1 tag.

## `flask-oso` 0.6.0

Bumped the minimum required version of the `oso` dependency.

## `sqlalchemy-oso` 0.2.1

### Breaking changes

**WARNING**: This release contains breaking changes. Be sure
to follow migration steps before upgrading.

#### Simplified `sqlalchemy-oso` session creation

`sqlalchemy-oso` now associates the current Oso instance, user to authorize,
and action to authorize with
`sqlalchemy_oso.session.AuthorizedSession`. This class manages
authorization instead of the removed
`sqlalchemy_oso.hooks.make_authorized_query_cls`.


* The `sqlalchemy_oso.hooks` module has been renamed to
`sqlalchemy_oso.session`. Update any imports to `sqlalchemy_oso.session`.


* The `sqlalchemy_oso.hooks.make_authorized_query_cls` function has been
removed. Use the session API instead.
(`sqlalchemy_oso.authorized_sessionmaker()`).


* The `sqlalchemy_oso.authorized_sessionmaker` function no longer accepts
extra positional arguments. Use keyword arguments to pass options to the
session.

### New features

#### Improved `sqlalchemy-oso` support for usage with `flask_sqlalchemy`

The `sqlalchemy-oso` library now has a built-in wrapper class that makes it
easier to use with the popular [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-SQLAlchemy/) library. See
`sqlalchemy_oso.flask.AuthorizedSQLAlchemy` for more information.

#### `scoped_session` support for `sqlalchemy-oso`

The new `sqlalchemy_oso.session.scoped_session()` session proxy can be
used instead of SQLAlchemy’s built-in [scoped_session](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/contextual.html#sqlalchemy.orm.scoping.scoped_session). This creates a session
scoped to the current Oso instance, user and action.

#### Initial support for built-in roles in `sqlalchemy-oso`

This release includes the first steps towards out-of-the-box role-based access
control (RBAC) support in the `sqlalchemy-oso` integration. New to the
integration is an API for easily creating roles scoped to a resource and
assigning them to users of your application. You are then able to write RBAC
rules over those managed roles.

We will be iterating heavily on this feature over the coming weeks, but we
would love to hear any feedback from early testers.

### Other bugs & improvements


* `matches` operations on fields of partials are now handled correctly in the
SQLAlchemy list filtering adapter. Previously these operations would result
in an error.


* The SQLAlchemy list filtering adapter now supports all comparisons. Previously
comparisons other than `==` or `=` would cause an error.


* For the SQLAlchemy list filtering adapter, a rule like `allow(_, _, post:
Post) if _tag in post.tags;` now translates into a constraint that the post
must have at least 1 tag.
