## `go-oso` 0.11.0-alpha

This week we are releasing `go-oso` as an alpha release!
Download the package [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/osohq/go-oso),
and check out our [quick start](https://docs.osohq.com/v2/go/getting-started/quickstart.html)!

`go-oso` supports Go versions 1.12+.

The `go-oso` library is released as an alpha to provide an opportunity for
early users to give feedback while we complete our documentation, and add
support for the Polar REPL and Debugger before the full release.

If you're using Go, we'd love to hear from you! Join us in [Slack](http://join-slack.osohq.com).

## `sqlalchemy-oso` 0.5.0-beta
