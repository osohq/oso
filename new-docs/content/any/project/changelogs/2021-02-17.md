## `oso` ?.??.?

### Go

The go library now supports the repl, the debugger and has expanded documentation.

To build and run the standalone go repl you can `go build cmd/oso/oso.go` and then run it with `./oso my_policy.polar`.

You can also use oso.go as an example of how to start a go repl from your oso instance.

This is also the first "official" release!
