## What is Oso?

Oso is an batteries-included, open-source library for building authorization
into your application.

Oso helps you form a mental model for your
authorization needs by providing a set of frameworks and templates built on
top of a
declarative policy language called Polar. The Oso library provides a
simple API for querying Polar policies, which centralize authorization
logic, and middleware to help apply authorization in the right places. Oso
also provides a debugger and REPL for Polar, to help developers learn the
language and test their policies.


Oso lets you offload the thinking of how to design authorization and build
features fast, while keeping the flexibility to extend and customize as you
see fit.

Developers can typically write a working policy in <5 minutes, add Oso to an
app in <30 minutes, and use Oso to solve real authorization problems in a day
or two. To get started, you add the library to your application, create a new
Oso instance and load an Oso policy. You can mix and match any of Oso's
authorization templates to implement features like roles while also writing
custom policies that suit your application.
