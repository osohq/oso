# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Patterns

When managing access to resources within an application, it can be useful to
group permissions into **roles**, and assign these roles to users. This is
known as **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).**

While there is no one way to implement RBAC, there are two types of
relationships that must be considered in a roles system:

1. **User-role relationships** define what roles a user has. The relationship
   could be a direct assignment from user-to-role, but could also be an
   indirect relationship that depends on additional information.

2. **Role-permission relationships** define the access permissions that a role
   grants to a user. In Oso, permissions generally consist of an **action** and
   a **resource.**

Oso represents these relationships as rules in a policy file, written in our
declarative logic programming language called [Polar](polar-syntax). In
general, a policy specifies user-role relationships with `user_in_role` rules
and role-permission relationships with `role_allow` rules. The general form of
an [allow rule](glossary#allow-rules) that calls these rules looks like this:

```polar
allow(actor, action, resource) if
    user_in_role(actor, resource, role) and
    role_allow(role, action, resource);
```

The rest of this document explains how to implement these rules for the
following RBAC use cases:

- [Global Roles](#global-roles): roles that apply to users and resources
  globally across the application
- [Roles in a multi-tenant application](#roles-in-a-multi-tenant-application):
  roles that only apply to users and resources within a particular tenant
- [Role Hierarchies](#role-hierarchies): more senior roles inherit permissions
  from less senior roles
- [Resource-specific roles](#resource-specific-roles): roles that only apply to
  a particular resource
- [Using roles with user groups](#using-roles-with-user-groups): roles that
  apply to a group of users, rather than to an individual user
- [Implied roles](#implied-roles): roles that are assigned to users implicitly
  by the data model, rather than directly assigned

<!-- Benefits of RBAC (TODO) -->

## Global Roles

“Global” roles refers to a single set of roles that applies to the entire
application. Roles are not scoped to a particular domain, such as a tenant or a
resource. Global roles are often useful in single-tenant applications that
require a small set of roles

### User-role mappings

Static mappings between users and roles can be specified in Polar. This avoids
implementing user-role mappings in your application code but does mean that
role assignments must be hardcoded for all users.

This example assumes that users are stored as a `User` model but can be
represented by any object, including a simple string.

```polar
# Defining roles for users
user_in_role(user: User{username: "steve"}, "admin");
user_in_role(user: User{username: "leina"}, "admin");

# Assigning groups of users to the same role
user_in_role(user: User, "admin") if
    user.username in ["steve", "leina", "alex", "sam"];
```

To avoid hardcoding role assignments, which may be useful if you expect to
assign new users to roles dynamically, you can store user-role assignments in
your application and look up assignments in the policy:

```polar
# Get role assignment from user
user_in_role(user: User, role) if
    role = user.role;
```

### Role-permission mappings

Role permissions are defined in Polar with `role_allow` rules. These are very
similar to `allow` rules, but instead of taking an actor as the first argument,
they take a role.

```polar
# Allow the admin role to take any action on any resource
role_allow("admin", _action, _resource);

# Allow the member role to read and write to any blog post
role_allow("member", action: String, _resource: BlogPost) if
    action in ["read", "write"];
```

### Enabling roles

In order to use roles in your application, define an `allow` rule that uses the
role logic you’ve defined:

```polar
# Allow rule to enable role checking
allow(actor: User, action, resource) if
    user_in_role(actor, role) and
    role_allow(role, action, resource);
```

With the `allow` rule defined, you can query it using Oso (the following
example uses the Python library):

```python
@app.route('/blog_post/<int:id>', methods=["GET"])
def get_blog_post(request) if
    post = get_blog_post(id)
    oso.is_allowed(request.user, "read", post)
```

## Roles in a multi-tenant application

In multi-tenant applications, roles are usually scoped to only apply to users
and resources within a particular tenant.

### One-to-many tenant-user and tenant-resource relationships

A straight-forward multi-tenant RBAC system has the following characteristics:

- Users and resources can only belong to a single tenant
- The same set of roles exists for all tenants
- Roles have the same permissions for all tenants (e.g., `admin` in tenant_1
  provides the same access control rights as it does in tenant_2, but users in
  tenant_1 cannot access resources in tenant_2).

A role model that meets the above characteristics is very similar to the model
for [Global Roles](#global-roles).

We can reuse the `user_in_role` and `role_allow` building blocks from [Global
Roles](#global-roles) to create user-role and role-permission mappings. All
that is required to scope roles to single tenants is to check tenancy in the
`allow` rule that implements the role check:

```polar
# User-role mappings
user_in_role(User{username: "steve"}, "admin");
user_in_role(User{username: "leina"}, "admin");

# Role-permission mappings
role_allow(role: "admin", _action, resource);

# Allow rule to enable role checking with tenant scoping
allow(actor: User, action, resource) if
    actor.tenant = resource.tenant and
    user_in_role(actor, role) and
    role_allow(role, action, resource);
```

The above check will ensure that the user’s role will only apply to resources
within the same tenant as the user. This model requires that the tenant is
accessible on both user and resource objects.

### Many-to-many tenant-user relationships

In some applications, users can belong to multiple tenants, and may have
different roles in each tenant. An example of this is GitHub, where users can
belong to multiple organizations and may have a different role in each
organization.

#### User-role mappings

In this case, mapping users to roles actually becomes mapping users to roles
_and_ tenants. This can be done entirely in the policy with
`user_in_role_for_tenant` rules. This approach avoids needing to store any role
data in the application, but it does mean that role assignments are hardcoded
for all users.

```polar
# Per-tenant user-role mappings
user_in_role_for_tenant(user: User{name: "leina"}, "admin", tenant_id: 1);
user_in_role_for_tenant(user: User{name: "leina"}, "member", tenant_id: 2);
user_in_role_for_tenant(user: User{name: "steve"}, "admin", tenant_id: 2);
```

To avoid hardcoding role assignments for users, the user-role-tenant
assignments can be stored as application data. One implementation of this would
be to store the roles on the user model. Since users can have different roles
depending on the tenant, roles should be stored by tenant:

```polar
# Per-tenant user-role mappings, looked up from application data
user_in_role_for_tenant(user: User, role, tenant_id: Integer) if
    role in user.get_roles_by_tenant(tenant_id);
```

#### Role-permission mappings

As long as roles have the same permissions across all tenants, `role_allow`
rules can be used to specify role-permission mappings, as with single-tenant
roles.

```polar
# Allow the admin role to take any action on any resource
role_allow("admin", _action, _resource);
```

If roles have different permissions depending on the tenant, the `role_allow`
rule can be modified to take the tenant as an argument:

```polar
# Allow the admin role for tenant 1 to take any action on Foo resources
role_allow_for_tenant("admin", _action, _resource: Foo, tenant_id: 1);

# Allow the admin role for tenant 2 to take any action on Bar resources
role_allow_for_tenant("admin", _action, _resource: Bar, tenant_id: 2);
```

#### Enabling roles

To enable the above rules, write an `allow` rule that calls
`user_in_role_for_tenant` to get the relevant role, and then call `role_allow`.
The tenant ID of the resource is used to look up the role to make sure that the
role is associated with the same tenant as the resource the actor is trying to
access.

```polar
# Allow rule to enable role checking with tenant scoping
allow(actor: User, action, resource) if
    user_in_role_for_tenant(actor, role, resource.tenant_id) and
    role_allow(role, action, resource);
```

## Role Hierarchies

Role hierarchies represent a model where certain roles are senior to others.
More senior roles inherit permissions from less senior roles. For example, an
organization may have a “manager” role and a “programmer” role. The “manager”
role is more senior than the “programmer”, and therefore it inherits the
permissions of the “programmer” role in addition to its own permissions.

With roles represented as strings in Oso policies, role inheritance can be
represented with the following structure:

```polar
# Grant a role permissions that it inherits from a more junior role
role_allow(role, action, resource) if
    inherits_role(role, junior_role) and
    role_allow(junior_role, action, resource);

# Managers inherit all permissions provided by the "programmer" role
inherits_role("manager", "programmer");
```

By adding the above `role_allow` rule, any role hierarchies declared with
`inherits_role` rules will be enforced. Permissions should be assigned to roles
directly using `role_allow` rules:

```polar
# Programmers can perform any action on any programming resource
role_allow("programmer", _action, _resource: ProgrammingResource);

# Managers can perform any action on any manager resource
role_allow("manager", _action, _resource: ManagerResource);
```

With these roles in place, users with the “manager” role will be able to take
any action on both programming resources and manager resources.

Adding a new role to the hierarchy is very simple with this structure. For
example, adding an “admin” role that inherits permissions from the “manager”
role would require adding a single rule:

```polar
inherits_role("admin", "manager");
```

### Multiple Inheritance

This role hierarchy structure supports **multiple inheritance,** meaning that a
single role can inherit from multiple junior roles by adding more
`inherits_role` rules. For example, there may be a “test_engineer” role that
the “manager” also inherits permissions from. Simply adding another
`inherits_role` for “manager” will implement this model.

```polar
inherits_role("manager", "test_engineer");
```

## Resource-specific roles

When controlling access to more than one type of resource, it is often useful
to use roles that specifically apply to one resource or another. For example,
in a project management app there might be `Project` resources that have the
following roles: “member”, “developer”, and “manager”.

If these roles are predefined, they generally will confer the same permissions
across all `Project` resources, but the users assigned to the role will differ
from project-to-project. In other words, the role-permission mappings are
specific to the resource type, while the user-role mappings are specific to the
resource instance.

In some cases, there may be roles that should confer permissions to all
resources of a certain type.

This model can be implemented in Polar by implementing
`user_in_role_for_resource` and `role_allow` rules, which are enabled
with the following top-level `allow` rule:

```polar
allow(user, action, resource) if
    user_in_role_for_resource(user, role, resource) and
    role_allow(role, resource);
```

### User-role mappings

Users are generally assigned a resource-specific role on a per-resource basis.
A user could have the “member” role for Project 1 and the “admin” role for
Project 2, and the user’s access would be different for each resource. Users
can be mapped to roles on a per-resource basis in Polar by hardcoding the
user-role-resource assignments:

```polar
# Assign leina the "member" role for Project 1
user_in_role_for_resource(
    user: User{name: "leina"},
    role: "member",
    project: Project{id: 1});
```

To avoid hardcoding the user-role-resource assignments, the assignments can be
stored as application data and accessed from the policy.

There are a variety of ways to store these mappings in the application. The
following rules show how the mapping might be accessed in different ways,
depending on the mapping implementation:

```polar
# Get the user's role for a specific Project resource
# Roles are accessed by resource on the user object
user_in_role_for_resource(user: User, role, project: Project) if
    role = user.get_role_for_resource(project);

# Alternative to the above
# Users are accessed by role on the Project object
user_in_role_for_resource(user: User, role, project: Project) if
    user in project.get_members(role);

# Alternative to the above
# Roles are accessed by user on the Project object
user_in_role_for_resource(user: User, role, project: Project) if
    role = project.get_role(user);
```

### Role-permission mappings

Scoping the permissions of a role to a single resource type is straightforward
in Polar using rule specializers:

```polar
role_allow("member", "view", _resource: Project);
```

### Resource Hierarchies/ Nested Resources

It is common for resources to be nested inside of other resources. To propagate
access control through a resource hierarchy, it can be useful to use a role to
grant access to the top-level resource and to infer permissions for nested
resources based on that role. For example, there may be `Document` resources
nested within the `Project` resource, and the `Project` “member” role should
also grant certain kinds of access to documents within the project:

```polar
# Allow a user to "read" a document if they have the "member" role
# in the parent Project
allow(user, "read", doc: Document) if
    user_in_role(user, "member", doc.project);

# Alternative to the above
# User has the same role on a document that they have on the parent Project
user_in_role_for_resource(user: User, role, doc: Document) if
    user_in_role_for_resource(user, role, doc.Project);

# Allow members to "read" documents
role_allow("member", "read", _resource: Document);
```

## Using roles with user groups

### Assigning roles to user groups

Sometimes it is helpful to assign a role to a group of users rather than an
individual user. A good example of this is GitHub. In GitHub, users within an
Organization can be added to Teams. Roles can be assigned to teams instead of
directly to users, and the access granted by a team-level role applies to all
members of the team. For this example, let’s say that team-level roles are
scoped to resources:

```polar
# Get the groups for a user
user_in_group(user, group) if
    group in user.teams;

# Assign a role to a group
group_in_role_for_resource(
    group: Team{name: "backend_team"},
    role: "owner",
    resource: Repository{name: "backend_repo"});

# Users inherit roles from their groups
user_in_role_for_resource(user, role, resource) if
    user_in_group(user, group) and
    group_in_role_for_resource(group, role, resource);
```

### Roles within a hierarchy of groups

Applications often represent organization hierarchies by creating hierarchical
user groups. For example, GitHub supports nested Teams. Recursive
`group_in_role` rules can be used to propagate roles through a group hierarchy:

```polar
# Groups inherit roles from their parent groups
group_in_role_for_resource(group: Team, role, resource: Repository) if
    group_in_role_for_resource(group.parent_group, role, resource);
```

## Implied roles

Sometimes it is convenient for user-role relationships to be implied rather
than direct. For example, in GitHub’s permissions system, the user who owns an
organization or repository is assigned the “admin” role for that resource by
default.

Implied role assignments eliminate the need to keep direct user-role mappings
up to date in the event that the data they depend on changes. E.g., if a
repository changes ownership, the “admin” role should automatically be
reassigned to the new owner.

This can be implemented in Polar by adding conditions to the body of
`user_in_role` rules:

```polar
user_in_role_for_resource(user: User, "admin", resource: Repository) if
    user = resource.owner;
```
