# Adding roles with SQLAlchemy

The [`sqlalchemy_oso.roles`](reference/frameworks/sqlalchemy#sqlalchemy_osoroles) module
provides out-of-the-box Role-Based Access Control features that let you create
a roles system with a few lines of code, and specify role permissions in a
declarative Oso policy.

This guide walks you through how to use `sqlalchemy_oso` to add basic roles to a multi-tenant app.

We’re using a Flask app for this example, but the
`sqlalchemy_oso` library can be used with any Python application.
{{% /callout %}}

## 1. Set up the application

### Install the Oso SQLAlchemy package

Install the `sqlalchemy_oso` package.

```console
$ pip install sqlalchemy_oso
```

Alternatively, if you are starting from scratch, clone the [sample
application](https://github.com/osohq/oso-sqlalchemy-roles-guide/tree/main) and
use the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Add a method to initialize Oso and make the Oso instance available to your
application code. This method should initialize Oso and load your policy file,
which can be an empty `.polar` file. It should also call
`sqlalchemy_oso.session.set_get_session()` to configure access to the
SQLALchemy session Oso should use to make queries. Then call
`sqlalchemy_oso.roles.enable_roles()` to load the base Oso policy for roles:

```python
from .models import Base, User
from flask_oso import FlaskOso
from oso import Oso
from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models, set_get_session
from sqlalchemy_oso.roles import enable_roles

def init_oso(app):
    base_oso = Oso()
    oso = FlaskOso(base_oso)

    register_models(base_oso, Base)
    set_get_session(base_oso, lambda: g.session)
    base_oso.load_file("app/authorization.polar")
    app.oso = oso
    enable_roles(base_oso)
```

### Create a users model

Add a `User` model that will represent your app’s users (if you don’t already
have one):

```python
Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = Column(String())

    def repr(self):
        return {"id": self.id, "email": self.email}
```

### Create an organizations model

Add an organization model that will represent the organizations or tenants that
users belong to. The roles you create will be scoped to this model:

```python
class Organization(Base):
    __tablename__ = "organizations"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String())
    billing_address = Column(String())

    def repr(self):
        return {"id": self.id, "name": self.name}
```

### Add an endpoint that needs authorization

Create or choose an existing endpoint that will need authorization to access.
In our sample app we’ve created two endpoints that have different authorization
requirements: one to view repositories and another to view billing information.

Add policy checks to your code to control access to the protected endpoints:

```python
from flask import Blueprint, g, request, current_app
from .models import User, Organization, Repository

bp = Blueprint("routes", __name__)

@bp.route("/orgs/<int:org_id>/repos", methods=["GET"])
def repos_index(org_id):
    org = g.session.query(Organization).filter_by(id=org_id).first()
    current_app.oso.authorize(org, actor=g.current_user, action="LIST_REPOS")

    repos = g.session.query(Repository).filter_by(organization=org)
    return {f"repos": [repo.repr() for repo in repos]}

@bp.route("/orgs/<int:org_id>/billing", methods=["GET"])
def billing_show(org_id):
    org = g.session.query(Organization).filter_by(id=org_id).first()
    current_app.oso.authorize(org, actor=g.current_user, action="READ_BILLING")
    return {f"billing_address": org.billing_address}
```

Our example uses `flask_oso.FlaskOso.authorize()` to complete the policy check,
which returns a `403 Forbidden` response if the provided `actor` is not allowed
to take `action` on the `resource` passed as the first argument. If you’re not
using Flask, you can use `oso.Oso.is_allowed()` from our general-purpose
[Python package](reference).

Since we haven’t added any rules to our policy file yet, these endpoints will
return a `403 Forbidden` response to all requests.

## 2. Add roles

### Create the OrganizationRole class using the role mixin

The Oso SQLAlchemy library provides the
`sqlalchemy_oso.roles.resource_role_class()` method to generate a mixin which
creates a role model. Create the mixin by passing in the base, user, and
organization models, as well as the role names. Then create a role model that
extends it:

```python
from sqlalchemy_oso.roles import resource_role_class

OrganizationRoleMixin = resource_role_class(
    Base, User, Organization, ["OWNER", "MEMBER", "BILLING"]
)

class OrganizationRole(Base, OrganizationRoleMixin):
    def repr(self):
        return {"id": self.id, "name": str(self.name)}
```

### Specify role permissions

To give the roles permissions, write an Oso policy.

Since we already called `sqlalchemy_oso.roles.enable_roles()` in our
`init_oso()` method, you can write Polar `role_allow` rules over
`OrganizationRoles`:

```polar
### All organization roles let users read the organization
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole, "READ", _org: Organization);

### The member role can list repos in the org
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "MEMBER"}, "LIST_REPOS", _org: Organization);

### The billing role can view billing info
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "BILLING"}, "READ_BILLING", _org: Organization);
```

You can also specify a [hierarchical role
ordering](learn/roles#role-hierarchies) with `organization_role_order`
rules:

```polar
### Specify organization role order (most senior on left)
organization_role_order(["OWNER", "MEMBER"]);
organization_role_order(["OWNER", "BILLING"]);
```

For more details on the roles base policy, see [Built-in Role-Based Access
Control](learn/roles).

### Create an endpoint for assigning roles

Until you assign users to roles, they’ll receive a `403 FORBIDDEN` response if
they try to access either protected endpoint.

Next, add a new endpoint to your application that users can hit to assign
roles. To control who can assign roles, add another call to
`flask_oso.FlaskOso.authorize()`. Additionally, use the Oso role API to create
role assignments with `sqlalchemy_oso.roles.add_user_role()` and
`sqlalchemy_oso.roles.reassign_user_role()`:

```python
@bp.route("/orgs/<int:org_id>/roles", methods=["POST"])
def org_roles_new(org_id):
    org = g.session.query(Organization).filter_by(id=org_id).first()
    current_app.oso.authorize(org, actor=g.current_user, action="CREATE_ROLE")

    # Create role
    role_name = request.get_json().get("name")
    user_email = request.get_json().get("user_email")
    user = g.session.query(User).filter_by(email=user_email).first()

    # Try adding the user role
    try:
        add_user_role(g.session, user, org, role_name, commit=True)
    # If the user already has a role, reassign their role
    except Exception as e:
        reassign_user_role(g.session, user, org, role_name, commit=True)

    return f"created a new role for org: {org_id}, {user_email}, {role_name}"
```

### Configure permissions for role assignments

Update the Oso policy to specify who is allowed to assign roles:

```polar
### The owner role can assign roles within the org
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "OWNER"}, "CREATE_ROLE", _org: Organization);
```

## 3. Test it works

### Run the application

Start the server:

```console
$ flask run
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Make a simple request:

```console
$ curl --header "user: ringo@beatles.com" localhost:5000/
Hello ringo@beatles.com
```

### Try it out

Try to access the protected endpoints. Access should be granted or denied based
on your policy. Our sample app includes some fixture data for testing. To run
the server with fixture data, set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable:

```console
$ export FLASK_APP="app:create_app(None, True)"
$ flask run
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Our policy says that users with the “OWNER” role can assign roles, users with
the “MEMBER” role can view repositories, and users with the “BILLING” role can
view billing info. Also, the “OWNER” roles inherits the permissions of the
“MEMBER” and “BILLING” roles.

Paul is a member of “The Beatles” organization, so he can view repositories but
not billing info:

```console
$ curl --header "user: paul@beatles.com" localhost:5000/orgs/1/repos
{"repos":[{"id":1,"name":"Abbey Road"}]}

$ curl --header "user: paul@beatles.com" localhost:5000/orgs/1/billing
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>403 Forbidden</title>
<h1>Forbidden</h1>
<p>Unauthorized</p>
```

John is the owner of “The Beatles” so he can assign roles:

```console
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "user: john@beatles.com"  \
--request POST \
--data '{"name":"BILLING", "user_email":"ringo@beatles.com"}' \
http://localhost:5000/orgs/1/roles
created a new role for org: 1, ringo@beatles.com, BILLING
```

But Ringo isn’t an owner, so his access should be denied:

```console
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "user: ringo@beatles.com"  \
--request POST \
--data '{"name":"BILLING", "user_email":"ringo@beatles.com"}' \
http://localhost:5000/orgs/1/roles
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>403 Forbidden</title>
<h1>Forbidden</h1>
<p>Unauthorized</p>
```
