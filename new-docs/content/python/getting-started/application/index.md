# Add To Your Application

This guide covers a little more detail about how to add Oso to your
application.

Whereas in the [Quickstart]({{< relref path="getting-started/quickstart"
lang="java" >}}) we zoomed through an
example of authorization in a simple web server, in this guide we'll show
some more practical examples in the context of a more realistic application.

Our sample expenses application is built with Flask, but we are not using
anything from Oso that is unique to Flask, and the same patterns we cover here
can be used anywhere.

We highly encourage you to follow along with the code by cloning the example repository
and trying it out. The code can be found here:

[osohq/oso-flask-tutorial](https://github.com/osohq/oso-flask-tutorial)

Our expenses application reads from a sqlite database, and has a few simple endpoints for returning results. We encourage you to take a look around before continuing!

## Running The Example

The application has a few requirements, including Flask and, of course, Oso.
We recommend installing these within a virtual environment:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/osohq/oso-flask-tutorial/
$ cd oso-flask-tutorial/
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ FLASK_ENV=development flask run --extra-files app/authorization.polar
```

The example comes with some example data, which you can load with:

```console
$ sqlite3 expenses.db ".read expenses.sql"
```

## In Your Application

There are two pieces to get started with Oso in your application.
The policy file, and the `oso.is_allowed` call.

The policy file captures the authorization logic you want to apply in your application, and the `oso.is_allowed` call is used to enforce that policy in your application.

When starting out, it is reasonable to capture all policy logic in a single `authorization.polar` file, as we have done here. However, over time you will want to break it up into multiple files.

Additionally, there are two main places where we want to enforce our authorization logic: at the request/API layer, and at the data access layer.

The goal of the former is to restrict which _actions_ a user can take in your application, e.g. are they allowed to fetch the expenses report via the `GET /expenses/report` route.

The goal of the latter is to restrict them from viewing data they
shouldn't have access to, e.g. they should not be able to see other users' data.

### Add Oso

In our sample application, we are storing our policies in the `authorization.polar`
file, and all of the authorization in the application is managed through the
`authorization.py` file.

In the application, we need to:

1. Create the Oso instance
2. Load in policy files.
3. [Register application classes](application-types)
4. Attach the Oso instance to the application

We have achieved this using the `init_oso` method:

{{< code file="authorization.py" >}}
def init_oso(app):
    from .expense import Expense
    from .organization import Organization
    from .user import Actor, Guest, User

    oso = Oso()
    oso.register_class(Actor)
    oso.register_class(Guest)
    oso.register_class(User)
    oso.register_class(Expense)
    oso.register_class(Organization)
    oso.register_class(Request)

    for policy in app.config.get("OSO_POLICIES", []):
        oso.load_file(policy)

    app.oso = oso
{{< /code >}}

We can now access this `oso` instance anywhere in our application, and specify
which policy files are loaded in the application configuration.

### Authorizing Routes

We can apply apply authorization to **every** incoming request by setting up
a middleware function that runs before every request using `before_app_request`:

{{< code file="authorization.py" >}}
@bp.before_app_request
def authorize_request():
    """Authorize the incoming request"""
    r = request._get_current_object()
    if not current_app.oso.is_allowed(g.current_user, r.method, r):
        return Forbidden("Not Authorized!")
{{< /code >}}

Now that this is in place, we can write a simple policy to allow anyone
to call our index route, and see the hello message:

{{< code file="authorization.polar" >}}
allow(_user, "GET", request: Request) if
    request.getServletPath() = "/";
{{< /code >}}

```console
$ curl localhost:5000/
hello Guest
$ curl -H "user: alice@foo.com"  localhost:5000/
hello alice@foo.com
```

But we also have a `/whoami` route that returns a short description of
the current user. We want to make sure only authenticated users can see
this.

We have two different user types here: the `Guest` class and the `User`
class. The latter corresponds to users who have authenticated.

{{< code file="user.py" >}}
class Guest(Actor):
    """Anonymous user."""

@dataclass
class User(Actor):
    """Logged in user. Has an email address."""

    id: int
    email: str
    title: str
    location_id: int
    organization_id: int
    manager_id: int
{{< /code >}}

We can use [specializer rules](polar-syntax#specialization) to only allow the request
when the actor is an instance of a `User`:

{{< code file="authorization.polar" >}}
allow(_user: User, "GET", request: Request) if
    request.getServletPath() = "/whoami";
{{< /code >}}

```console
$ curl localhost:5000/whoami
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>403 Forbidden</title>
<h1>Forbidden</h1>
<p>Not Authorized!</p>

$ curl -H "user: alice@foo.com"  localhost:5000/whoami
You are alice@foo.com, the CEO at Foo Industries. (User ID: 1)
```

The inputs to the `is_allowed` call are the current user, the HTTP method,
and the HTTP request. This information can often be enough to cover a large
number of uses. For example, if we know that some paths should only
be accessed by certain roles, we can certainly check for this at this point.

In a RESTful application, you can also consider "mapping" authorization
logic from the HTTP path to actions and classes in the application.

For example:

{{< code file="authorization.polar" >}}
allow(user, "GET", http_request) if
    http_request.startswith("/expenses/")
    and allow(user, "read", Expense);
{{< /code >}}

This rule is translating something like `GET /expenses/3` into a check
whether the user should be allowed to "read" the `Expense` class.

However, what if we want to have more fine-grained control? And
authorize access to the precise resource at `/expenses/3`? We'll cover
that in the next section.

### Authorizing Access to Data

In the [Quickstart](quickstart), our main objective was to
determine who could "GET" expenses. Our final policy looked like:

{{< code file="expenses.polar" >}}
allow(actor: String, "GET", expense: Expense) if
    expense.submitted_by = actor;
{{< /code >}}

In our expenses sample application, we have something similar,
but we've rewritten the policy to use a new `submitted` predicate in case we want
to change the logic in the future.

{{< code file="authorization.polar" >}}
allow(user: User, "read", expense: Expense) if
    submitted(user, expense);

submitted(user: User, expense: Expense) if
    user.id = expense.user_id;
{{< /code >}}

To handle authorizing access to data, we've implemented a little helper method
for us to use throughout the application:

{{< code file="authorization.py" >}}
def authorize(action, resource):
    """Authorize whether the current user can perform `action` on `resource`"""
    if current_app.oso.is_allowed(g.current_user, action, resource):
        return resource
    else:
        raise Forbidden("Not Authorized!")
{{< /code >}}

... so authorizing the GET request looks like:

{{< code file="expense.py" >}}
def get_expense(id):
    expense = Expense.lookup(id)
    return str(authorize("read", expense))
{{< /code >}}

Let's give it a try!

```console
$ curl localhost:5000/expenses/2
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>403 Forbidden</title>
<h1>Forbidden</h1>
<p>Not Authorized!</p>

$ curl -H "user: alice@foo.com" localhost:5000/expenses/2
Expense(amount=17743, description='Pug irony.', user_id=1, id=2)
```

This pattern is pretty convenient. We can easily apply it elsewhere:

{{< code file="organization.py" >}}
def get_organization(id):
    organization = Organization.lookup(id)
    return str(authorize("read", organization))
{{< /code >}}

```console
$ curl -H "user: alice@foo.com" localhost:5000/organizations/1
Organization(name='Foo Industries', id=1)

$ curl -H "user: alice@foo.com" localhost:5000/organizations/2
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>403 Forbidden</title>
<h1>Forbidden</h1>
<p>Not Authorized!</p>
```

Applying this pattern to authorizing data means that the objects we are
passing in to the policy evaluation are already fairly rich objects,
with attributes and methods we can use to make policy decisions. When
starting out, it might be more convenient to apply in the route handler
itself, but try moving it even closer to the data access layer. For
example, if we moved the `authorize` call into the `Expense.lookup`
method, then anywhere our application wants to retrieve an expense, we
are assured that the user does indeed have access to it.

## Your Turn

We currently have a route with no authorization - the submit endpoint.
We have a rule that allows anyone to PUT to the submit endpoint, but we
want to make sure only authorized expenses are submitted.

{{< code file="authorization.polar" >}}
allow_by_path(_user, "PUT", "expenses", ["submit"]);
{{< /code >}}

{{% callout "Tip" "green" %}}
The `allow_by_path` rule is a custom rule in our policy that operates
on an actor, action, first url path fragment, and the remaining path
fragment. A `PUT /expenses/submit` request would try to authorize
using the `allow_by_path(actor, "PUT", "expenses", ["submit"])` rule.
See [our policy](https://github.com/osohq/oso-flask-tutorial/blob/ecc39c601057bcfdb952e35da616fe2e1ea00a22/app/authorization.polar#L10) for more detail.
{{% /callout %}}

Right now you can see that anyone can submit an expense:

```console
$ curl -H "user: alice@foo.com" \
  -X PUT -d '{"amount": 100, "description": "Gummy Bears"}' \
  localhost:5000/expenses/submit
Expense(amount=100, description='Gummy Bears', user_id=1, id=108)
```

How might we use the `authorize` method from before, to make sure that
we check the user is allowed to `create` this expense?
We would like to do the authorization on the full `Expense` object,
but before it is persisted to the database, so perhaps between these two
lines:

{{< code file="expense.py">}} # hl_lines=[7-8]
def submit_expense():
    expense_data = request.get_json(force=True)
    if not expense_data:
        raise BadRequest()
    # if no user id supplied, assume it is for the current user
    expense_data.setdefault("user_id", g.current_user.id)
    expense = Expense(**expense_data)
    expense.save()
    return str(expense)
{{< /code >}}

We could change the first highlighted line to:

```python
expense = authorize("create", Expense(**expense_data))
```

This checks the current user is authorized to create the expense.
If this passes, then we can happily move on to the `expense.save()`.
Now, nobody will be able to submit expenses, since we haven't yet
added any rules saying they can.

{{% callout "Add a new rule" "green" %}}
Try editing `authorization.polar` to add a rule saying that
a user can create an expense for which they are assigned as the
submitter of the expense.
{{% /callout %}}

Try editing `authorization.polar` to add a rule saying that a user can
create an expense for which they are assigned as the submitter of the
expense.

Once you have it working, you can test it by verifying as follows:

```console
$ curl -H "user: alice@foo.com" -X PUT -d '{"user_id": 1, "amount": 100, "description": "Gummy Bears"}' localhost:5000/expenses/submit
Expense(amount=100, description='Gummy Bears', user_id=1, id=111)

$ curl -H "user: alice@foo.com" -X PUT -d '{"user_id": 2, "amount": 100, "description": "Gummy Bears"}' localhost:5000/expenses/submit
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<title>403 Forbidden</title>
<h1>Forbidden</h1>
<p>Not Authorized!</p>
```

## Summary

In this guide, we showed a few examples of how to add Oso to a more
realistic application. We added some route-level authorization to
control who is allowed to make requests to certain routes. We also used
a new `authorize` method to make it convenient to add data access
controls to our route handlers.
