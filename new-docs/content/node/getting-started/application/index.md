# Add Oso to a Node.js Application

{{% coming_soon %}}

In the meantime, here are some resources that might help you get started.

## NestJS library by Bjerk AS

The good folks at [Bjerk AS][bjerk] have made a [NestJS][nestjs] integration
for Oso available via [GitHub][nestjs-oso-github] and [npm][nestjs-oso-npm].
Its documentation includes a Quickstart guide.

## Sam's blog post

Oso CTO Sam Scott blogged about [Adding Authorization to a Node.js
App][adding-authorization-post]. That post also uses [NestJS][nestjs] as a
framework, but without the adapter library above. It also explores some common
authorization patterns and how to express them in that framework.
