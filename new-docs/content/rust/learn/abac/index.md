title: Attribute-Based Access Control
weight: 2
description: |
    Attribute-based access control relies on rich attributes associated with
    each actor to make authorization decisions. This model is often used when
    RBAC is not expressive enough, and is a natural extension of RBAC when
    using Oso.
