title: Model your authorization logic
description: |
    Authorization in Oso starts with the policy. Authorization policies
    define the resources that you want to control access to, and rules that
    specify when an actor (the user making the request) can perform an
    action on a resource. Because Oso is a library, you can write
    authorization policies directly over the same data types that are
    already used in your application.
