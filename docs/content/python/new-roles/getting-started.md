# Getting started

When managing access to resources within an application, it can be useful to
group permissions into **roles**, and assign these roles to users. This is
known as **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).** The SQLAlchemy roles
library extends the ``Oso`` core library with built in configuration,
data modeling and enforcement of role-based access control.

In this guide, we'll walk through the basics of starting to use the
SQLAlchemy roles library, using the
[GitClub](https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react)
application as an example. GitClub is a SPA (single-page application)
that uses Flask and SQLAlchemy for the backend, with a React frontend.
To install **GitClub** to run alongside this tutorial, follow the
[`README`](https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react#readme).

## Installation
Even if you're already using `sqlalchemy-oso`, you'll still need to install the new python package. Make sure you update your imports to import from `sqlalchemy-oso-preview`.
See our [installation instructions](install).

## Setting up the Oso Instance

Oso is a library that we use in our application for authorization. It
requires no additional infrastructure. Instead, the SQLAlchemy library
helps you authorize data in your existing data store. Data required for
authorization (like role assignment) is stored in the same database as
the rest of your application data.

First, we'll cover some of the basics of integrating Oso into your
application.

The `Oso` class is the entrypoint to using Oso in our application. We
usually will have a global instance that is created during application
initialization, and shared across requests. In a Flask application, you
may attach this instance to the global flask object, or the current
application if it needs to be accessed outside of the application
initialization process.

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/__init__.py"
    from="docs: begin-init-oso"
    to="Register authorization data"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
>}}

### Registering authorization data types

Oso policies are written over the data in our application that we'd like
to authorize. The policy can directly reference the same types we use in
our application. First, we must register our classes with Oso using
`Oso.register_class`.

Since we are using Oso with SQLAlchemy, we need
to make Oso aware of our SQLAlchemy models. Later, we'll write
authorization rules to control access to our models.

The `sqlalchemy_oso.register_models` function helps us register
SQLAlchemy ORM models with Oso.

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/__init__.py"
    from="docs: begin-init-oso"
    to="OsoRoles"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
    hlOpts="hl_lines=6"
>}}

This registers all models that inherit from `Base` with Oso for use in
our policy.

### Loading our policy

Oso uses the Polar language to define authorization policies. An
authorization policy specifies what requests are allowed and what data a
user can access. The policy is stored in a Polar file, along with your
code.

Load the policy with the `Oso.load_file` function.

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/__init__.py"
    from="docs: begin-init-oso"
    to="Attach Oso"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
    hlOpts="hl_lines=10-11"
>}}


## Writing an authorization rule over a SQLAlchemy model

Now that we've setup Oso, we can write rules in our Polar policy to
control access to SQLAlchemy models. The entrypoint
to a policy is the `allow` rule, which specifies when an `actor` can
perform an `action` on a particular `resource`.

We can write simple rules in our policy, like this one which allows all
users to create new organizations:

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/authorization.polar"
    from="docs: org-create-rule"
    to="end: org-create-rule"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
>}}

This is an `allow` rule. The arguments are the `actor`, `action` and
`resource` being authorized. Our rule has the following behavior for
each argument:

- `_: User`: the `actor` argument must have the `User` type. Since the
  argument is unused we name it `_`.
- `"create"`: the `action` must match the string literal `"create"`
- `_: Org`: the `resource` argument must have the `Org` type.

Notice that `User` and `Org` are SQLAlchemy models. We can reference
these in our policy because we registered them with `register_models`!

For more on policy basics see our [writing policies
guide](/getting-started/policies).

## Enforcing authorization in our routes

To perform authorization, we use the `Oso.is_allowed` method. Here's an
example in our Org creation handler:

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/routes.py"
    from="docs: begin-is-allowed"
    to="docs: end-is-allowed"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
>}}

The policy is consulted to see if there is an `allow` rule that permits
access for the `actor`, `action` and `resource` arguments passed to
`is_allowed`. We can access types and attributes of the objects passed
into our rules from within the policy, just like we can in Python!
More on this [here]({{< ref
"/getting-started/policies.md#instances-and-fields" >}}).


## SQLAlchemy Session Setup

Oso integrates with SQLAlchemy [sessions](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session_basics.html#what-does-the-session-do) to authorize access to models.
In a typical application, we may have one SQLAlchemy session per
request. Often this is accomplished with a session factory that is
scoped to the [current
thread](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/contextual.html).

When using Oso, two SQLAlchemy sessions are usually necessary:

- *authorized session*: A session instance that will only return
  authorized objects from a query. An authorized session is fixed to one
  *authorization query* (that is one set of `actor`, `action`, and `resource`
  type). *An authorized session only applies authorization on read
  queries*. To authorize mutations to single objects, use `is_allowed`.
- *basic session*: A session instance that returns all data, including
  data not authorized for the current user.

### Using the authorized session

The authorized session is used for fetching data from the database that
must be limited to the current user. When performing authorization, Oso
uses [data filtering](../../guides/data_access) to translate the
policy's rules into a SQLAlchemy query. Only authorized objects will be
fetched from the database.

The authorized session is typically created during application
initialization using `sqlalchemy_oso.authorized_sessionmaker`.
Here's how we create it in GitClub:

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/__init__.py"
    lines="10,14,34-40,92"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
    >}}

Before each request we fetch the logged in user and set the action
depending upon the route.

We can then issue regular SQLAlchemy queries to load authorized data:

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/routes.py"
    from="docs: begin-repo-index"
    to="docs: end-repo-index"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
    >}}

`repos` will only contain repositories that `g.current_user` is allowed to take `g.current_action` on based on our policy.

### Using the basic session

The basic session should be used for queries that should not have
authorization applied. We create one using a typical SQLAlchemy `sessionmaker`.

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/__init__.py"
    lines="4,14,29,61"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
>}}

Often performing actions before authorization like authentication will use
the basic session:

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/__init__.py"
    from="docs: begin-authn"
    to="docs: end-authn"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
>}}

## Controlling access with roles

Now, let's write our first rules that use role based access control. To
setup the role library, we must:

1. Initialize `OsoRoles`
2. Persist role configuration to our database.
3. Add role and resource configurations to our policy.
4. Use the `Roles.role_allows` method in our policy.
5. Assign roles to users.

### Initializing `OsoRoles`

`OsoRoles` extends Oso with role specific configuration & enforcement.
We enable it by initializing the `OsoRoles` object.

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/__init__.py"
    from="docs: begin-init-oso"
    to="docs: end-init-oso"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
    hlOpts="hl_lines=7"
    >}}

### Persisting roles configuration

Oso stores role and permission configuration in your database alongside
the rest of your SQLAlchemy tables. Additional models are added to your
`Base` class metadata when initializing `OsoRoles`. The schema for these
models can be created with [`MetaData.create_all`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/metadata.html#sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData.create_all).

In addition to the schema, we still must persist the role configuration
from the policy into the database. We do this with the
`OsoRoles.synchronize_data` method. The `synchronize_data` method will
replace all role configuration to reflect the `resource` definitions in
the policy.

In our sample app, we call `synchronize_data` in initialization of our app:

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/__init__.py"
    from="docs: begin-configure"
    to="docs: end-configure"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
    >}}

{{% callout "Going to production" "orange" %}}

Since `OsoRoles.synchronize_data()` performs bulk database operations, a
production application should call it as part of the deployment process
in a script.

{{% /callout %}}


{{% callout "Improved role configuration migrations coming soon" "green" %}}

Currently, `OsoRoles.synchronize_data` deletes and replaces all role
configuration in the database. In a future release, we will have a
migration tool that only synchronizes changes to the database, and warns
when removing roles or permissions that are in use.

Roles and permissions are stored in the database to allow creation of
dynamic role and permission assignments in a future release.

{{% /callout %}}


### Configuring our first resource

Roles in Oso are scoped to resources. A role is a grouping of
permissions that may be performed on that resource. Roles are assigned
to actors to grant them all the permissions the role has.

We define resources in Polar using the ``resource`` rule. The `Org`
resource represents an Organization in the GitClub example application.
Let's walk through the resource definition for `Org`.

```polar
resource(_type: Org, "org", actions, roles) if
```

The rule head has 4 parameters:

- `_type` is the SQLAlchemy model the resource definition is associated with.
- `"org"` is the identifier for this resource type (this can be any string
you choose).
- `actions` are set in the rule body. The `actions` list defines all the
  actions that may be performed on the resource.
- `roles` are set in the rule body. The `roles` dictionary defines all the
  roles for this resource.

In our rule body, we first define the list of available actions for this
resource:

```polar
resource(_type: Org, "org", actions, roles) if
    actions = ["read", "create_repo"] and
    roles = {
        ...
    };
```

Now, we define our roles. Roles are defined in a dictionary that maps
the role name to a role configuration.

```polar
resource(_type: Org, "org", actions, roles) if
    actions = ["read", "create_repo"] and
    roles = {
        org_member: {
            perms: ["read"],
        },
        org_owner: {
            perms: ["read", "create_repo"],
        }
    };
```

This resource definition defines two roles:

- *org_member*: Has the `read` permission.
- *org_owner*: Has the `read` and `create_repo` permissions.

Permissions are actions associated with a resource type. A permission can
directly reference an action defined in the same resource. Later, we'll
see how to add permissions defined on other resources to roles.

{{% callout "resource(...) is just a rule" "blue" %}}

The `resource` definition is just a regular Polar rule. That's why it
has an `if` and `and` between variable assignments. `actions` and
`roles` are unbound parameters, meaning they can be assigned inside of
the rule body.

We could have written this rule without a body, like:

```polar
resource( _type: Org, "org", ["read", "create_repo"],
    {
        org_member: {
            perms: ["read"],
        },
        org_owner: {
            perms: ["read", "create_repo"],
        }
    }
);
```

But, we think the expanded form is clearer.

{{% /callout %}}

### Adding role_allows to our policy

To allow access based on roles, we call `Roles.role_allows` in our
policy:

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/authorization.polar"
    from="docs: begin-role-allow"
    to="docs: end-role-allow"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
>}}

Oso will now allow access to any resource that is allowed based on the
role definitions.

### Assigning roles to users

Now we've configured roles and setup our policy. For users to have
access, we must assign them to roles.

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/routes.py"
    from="docs: begin-role-assignment"
    to="docs: end-role-assignment"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
    hlOpts="hl_lines=10"
    >}}

The `assign_role` method assigns a particular role on a resource.
Often, you'll make this available in a route so that end users can
configure role assignments for their organization. More on this in [end
user configuration](end_user_configuration).

Role assignment is stored your database along with the rest of your
SQLAlchemy managed data.

### Implying roles

The `"org_owner"` role is a more permissive role than `"org_member"`. It
covers all the permissions of `"org_member"`, with some additional
permissions granted (`"create_repo"`) in our example.

Instead of duplicating the permissions, we can represent this
relationship in our policy using **implied roles**.

```polar
resource(_type: Org, "org", actions, roles) if
    actions = ["read", "create_repo"] and
    roles = {
        org_member: {
            perms: ["read"],
        },
        org_owner: {
            perms: ["create_repo"],
            implies: ["org_member"]
        }
    };
```

The `"org_owner"` now implies the `"org_member"` role. Any user with the
`"org_owner"` role will be granted all permissions associated with both
roles.

Here's the full `Org` resource definition from the GitClub example app:

{{< literalInclude
    path="examples/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react/backend/app/authorization.polar"
    from="docs: begin-org-resource"
    to="docs: end-org-resource"
    gitHub="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react"
    linenos=true
>}}

Notice the `"repo_read"` and `"repo_write"` implications. These are
roles defined on another resource, Repository. In the next guide, we'll
see how to setup **cross resource implied roles** like these!
