SQLAlchemy Roles Early Access
=============================

We're working on the next major version of the SQLAlchemy roles library.
This library makes it easy to model role based access control in Polar
and enforce it over your SQLAlchemy models.

The library is now available for early access. Our team continues to
iterate on it and is excited to hear your feedback.

The SQLAlchemy roles library is accompioned by [GitClub](), our best
practice example app for using Oso with SQLAlchemy.

This section of the documentation contains guides and reference for
using the new SQLAlchemy library. If you'd like to use the currently
released version [see here](/reference/frameworks/sqlalchemy).

Have feedback on this documentation or the library itself? It's under
active development. Our engineering team would love to [hear from you in
Slack.](https://join-slack.osohq.com/)
