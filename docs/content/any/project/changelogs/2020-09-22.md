## `oso` 0.6.0

### Major news

#### Rust support!

Oso now supports applications written in Rust, using our Rust library. Download here.

### Breaking changes

**WARNING**: This release contains breaking changes. Be sure
to follow migration steps before upgrading.

#### Updated `new` operator syntax

Previously, the `new` operator could take one of two forms:

> ```
> new Foo()

> new Foo{}
> ```

The former accepted positional arguments, and the latter accepted keyword
arguments. In this release, the two forms have combined their powers, and
positional and keyword arguments can both be passed via the parenthetical
syntax:

> ```
> new Foo(1, 2, foo: 3, bar: 4)
> ```

Keyword arguments *must* follow positional arguments, and they are not
supported in languages that themselves do not support keyword arguments, such
as Java and JavaScript (Node.js).

The curly brace syntax (`new Foo{}`) is no longer valid Polar and will fail
to parse.

Migrate to the new constructor syntax by replacing curly braces with
parentheses.

#### Renamed Python error type

The main Python error type is now called `OsoError` to be more consistent
with the other libraries.

Any error handling catching `OsoException` should be updated to instead
catch `OsoError`.

### New features

#### Keyword arguments now supported in method calls

In languages that support keyword arguments, they may now be passed to method
calls using the following syntax:

> ```
> foo.bar(1, 2, foo: 3, bar: 4)
> ```

See Application Field or Method Access.

### Other bugs & improvements


* Java instances may now be unified against other Java instances:

```
new Foo() = new Foo()
```


* Fixed rule filtering when the input arguments are bound variables.
Fixes a performance regression for certain types of policy.


* The Polar `Variable` type in Python is now printed as `Variable(name)`.


* Any rule with a specializer is ordered above a rule without a specializer.


* Error handling in Python is now more consistent with the other libraries.
