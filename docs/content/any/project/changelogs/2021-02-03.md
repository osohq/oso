## `go-oso` 0.11.0-alpha

This week we are releasing `go-oso` as an alpha release!
Download the package [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/osohq/go-oso),
and check out our [quick start](quickstart)!

`go-oso` supports Go versions 1.12+.

The `go-oso` library is released as an alpha to provide an opportunity for
early users to give feedback while we complete our documentation, and add
support for the Polar REPL and Debugger before the full release.

If you're using Go, we'd love to hear from you! Join us in [Slack](https://join-slack.osohq.com).

## `oso` 0.10.1

### Other improvements

* Support for converting floats from Go into the Polar numeric type.

## `sqlalchemy-oso` 0.4.1

* Support for using SQLAlchemy Roles with resources that have a primary key
  column that is not named `id`.

## `sqlalchemy-oso` 0.5.0-beta

`sqlalchemy-oso` 0.5.0-alpha has been promoted to 0.5.0-beta.

If you're using the beta release and have feedback, join us in [Slack](https://join-slack.osohq.com).

## `django-oso` 0.7.0-beta

* Support for Django 2.2. `django-oso` 0.7.0-beta is tested against Django 2.2
  to ensure backwards compatibility.
* Conversion of partial expressions into Django `QuerySet` filters has been
  updated to ensure backwards compatibility.
