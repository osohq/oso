#### Other bugs & improvements

- Thanks to [`@alexhafner`](https://github.com/alexhafner) for updating our tooling, making it easier

### `oso-sqlalchemy 0.26.2`

#### Improved class registration

#### Other bugs & improvements.

A new `loadFilesFromResources` API has been added to allow loading policy source code from resource files contained in your packaged `.jar`. Special thanks to [`@kovacstamasx`](https://github.com/kovacstamasx) for this contribution.


### Ruby
