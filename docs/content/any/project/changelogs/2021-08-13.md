## `oso` 0.15.0

### Core

#### Breaking changes

{{% callout "Warning" "orange" %}}

  before upgrading.
{{% /callout %}}

- Changes to the query format affect ORM integrations. If you use one, be sure to update!

#### Other bugs & improvements

- Performance for large policies has been improved.
- Constraints applied to unbound variables no longer prevent the variables from becoming bound. For example:

```
parent_child(org: Org, repo: Repo) if org = repo.org;
```

will now work as expected when called with an unbound first argument; previously it was necessary to write

```
parent_child(org, repo: Repo) if org = repo.org and org matches Org;
```

to obtain the same behavior.
