## `oso` `0.25.0`

### Core

#### Other bugs & improvements

- Fixed a variable scope bug affecting the `forall` operator that caused affected
  queries to fail with an `UnhandledPartial` error.
- Subsequent unification of incompatibly type-constrained variables will now fail
  correctly.
- The operators `not`, `forall`, `or`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` can now be used
  with data filtering.
- Fixed an issue with incompatible types being assigned to variables during rule
  matching.

### Node.js

##### Second parameter of Oso.query() API changed from bindings to options

Pre-seeding the Polar VM with bindings for a query is a bit of an advanced use
case, but if you were previously passing bindings to `Oso.query()`:

```js
const bindings = new Map([['x', 1]]);
oso.query('f(x)', bindings);
```

You'll need to update that call to pass `bindings` as a key in the new
`QueryOpts` object:

```js
const bindings = new Map([['x', 1]]);
oso.query('f(x)', { bindings });
```

#### Other bugs & improvements

- Thanks to [`@Kn99HN`](https://github.com/Kn99HN) for adding the
  `acceptExpression` query flag to the Node.js lib!

## `sqlalchemy-oso` `NEW_VERSION`

### Other bugs & improvements

- `scoped_session` now correctly handles a `get_checked_permission` callback that
  returns `None`.

## `RELEASED_PACKAGE_1` NEW_VERSION

### LANGUAGE (e.g., 'Core' or 'Python' or 'Node.js')
