## `oso` 0.20.1

### Core

#### Breaking changes

{{% callout "Warning" "orange" %}}
  This release contains breaking changes. Be sure to follow migration steps
  before upgrading.
{{% /callout %}}

##### `or` / `and` operator precedence

The `or` operator has had its precedence lowered to be consistent with other
programming languages. Existing policies using `or` should be updated where
necessary to group `or` operations using parentheses:

```polar
foo(a, b, c) if a and b or c;
```

would now be written

```polar
foo(a, b, c) if a and (b or c);
```

We have temporarily made policies which combine `and` and `or` _without_
using parentheses raise warnings in order to avoid silent changes.
To silence the error, add parentheses.

#### New features

##### Data Filtering

This release makes data filtering a core library feature. We have added a new method `authorized_resources(actor, action, class)` that returns all the resources of type `class` that the actor is allowed to do the action on. It requires registering some new information about classes and implementing some hooks to do the filtering. It is available for Python, Ruby and JavaScript and can be used with any ORM.
You can go to the [data filtering guide](https://docs.osohq.com/guides/data_filtering.html) to see how to use it.

##### New syntax for RBAC/ReBAC policies

This release introduces a new, shorthand syntax for declaring roles,
permissions, relations, and rules for a particular resource:

```polar
resource Repo {
  roles = ["reader", "writer"];
  permissions = ["pull", "push"];
  relations = { creator: User };

  "writer" if "creator";
  "reader" if "writer";

  "push" if "writer";
  "pull" if "reader";
}
```

Each of the shorthand rules is expanded into a full Polar rule. For example,
`"push" if "writer";` expands into the following rule:

```polar
has_permission(actor, "push", repo: Repo) if
  has_role(actor, "writer", repo);
```

And `"reader" if "writer";` expands to:

```polar
has_role(actor, "reader", repo: Repo) if
  has_role(actor, "writer", repo);
```

### Rust

#### Other bugs & improvements

- The rust library now prints messages and warnings directly to stdout and
  stderr respectively. This means that you can predictably enable Polar tracing
  by running with `POLAR_LOG=1`. Fixes issue
  [#824](https://github.com/osohq/oso/issues/824)
- The debugger can now break on rule matches.
- Polar reserved words (e.g. `type`, `if`, `debug`) can be used as field and method names in
  dictionaries and objects.
- Fixed a bug where unifying an external instance with a partially-bound
  variable in the head of a rule would add an additional constraint to the
  variable instead of rebinding it to the external instance.

### Node.js

#### Other bugs & improvements

- Fixed an issue where the data filtering `Relation` class wasn't exported
  from the top-level package.
