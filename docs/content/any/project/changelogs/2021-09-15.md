## `oso` 0.20.1

0.20.1 is the next stable release after 0.15.1.

### Core

#### Breaking changes

{{% callout "Warning" "orange" %}}
  This release contains breaking changes. Be sure to follow migration steps
  before upgrading.
{{% /callout %}}

##### `or` / `and` operator precedence

The `or` operator has had its precedence lowered to be consistent with other
programming languages. Existing policies using `or` should be updated where
necessary to group `or` operations using parentheses:

```polar
foo(a, b, c) if a and b or c;
```

would now be written

```polar
foo(a, b, c) if a and (b or c);
```

We have temporarily made policies which combine `and` and `or` _without_
using parentheses raise warnings in order to avoid silent changes.
To silence the error, add parentheses.

##### New policy loading API `load_files`. Deprecated `load_file`

`Oso.load_file(file_name)` has been deprecated and replaced with
`Oso.load_files([file1, file2])`. Users of `load_file` will receive a
deprecation warning.

Calling `load_file`, `load_files` or `load_str` more than once is now an error.

To migrate rewrite:

```python
oso.load_file("main.polar")
oso.load_file("repository.polar")
```

as

```python
oso.load_files(["main.polar", "repository.polar"])
```

`load_file` will be removed in a future release.

#### New features

##### Data Filtering

This release makes data filtering a core library feature. We have added
a new method `authorized_resources(actor, action, class)` that returns
all the resources of type `class` that the actor is allowed to do the
action on. It requires registering some new information about classes
and implementing some hooks to do the filtering. It is available for
Python, Ruby and JavaScript and can be used with any ORM.  You can go to
the [data filtering
guide](https://docs.osohq.com/guides/data_filtering.html) to see how to
use it.

##### Resource blocks for expressing role and relationship based authorization

This release introduces a new, shorthand syntax for declaring roles,
permissions, relations, and rules for a particular resource called
**Resource blocks**:

```polar
resource Repository {
	permissions = ["read", "push"];
	roles = ["contributor", "maintainer"];

	"read" if "contributor";
	"push" if "maintainer";

	"contributor" if "maintainer";
}
```

Each of the shorthand rules is expanded into a full Polar rule. For example,
`"read" if "contributor";` expands into the following rule:

```polar
has_permission(actor, "read", repository: Repository) if
  has_role(actor, "writer", repo);
```

And `"contributor" if "maintainer";` expands to:

```polar
has_role(actor, "contributor", repository: Repository) if
  has_role(actor, "maintainer", repository);
```

Read more in the [Build role-based-access control
documentation](/guides/rbac).

##### Enforcement API for resource, request and field-level authorization

This release adds new enforcement APIs for more specific enforcement
scenarios:

- `authorize(actor, action, resource)`: ensures an actor can perform a
  particular action on a resource (this is most similar to `is_allowed`).
- `authorize_request(actor, request)`: ensures an actor can send a particular
  request to the server.
- `authorize_field(actor, action, resource, field)`: ensures that an actor can
  perform an action on a particular field of a resource.

Read more about enforcers in the new [enforcement guide]({{< ref path="/guides/enforcement" lang=python >}}).

### Rust

#### Other bugs & improvements

- The rust library now prints messages and warnings directly to stdout and
  stderr respectively. This means that you can predictably enable Polar tracing
  by running with `POLAR_LOG=1`. Fixes issue
  [#824](https://github.com/osohq/oso/issues/824)
- The debugger can now break on rule matches.
- Polar reserved words (e.g. `type`, `if`, `debug`) can be used as field and method names in
  dictionaries and objects.
- Fixed a bug where unifying an external instance with a partially-bound
  variable in the head of a rule would add an additional constraint to the
  variable instead of rebinding it to the external instance.
