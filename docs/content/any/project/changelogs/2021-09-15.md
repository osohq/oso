## `oso` 0.20.1

### Core

#### Breaking changes

{{% callout "Warning" "orange" %}}
  This release contains breaking changes. Be sure to follow migration steps
  before upgrading.
{{% /callout %}}

### Rust

#### Other bugs & improvements

- The rust library now prints messages and warnings directly to stdout and
  stderr respectively. This means that you can predictably enable Polar tracing
  by running with `POLAR_LOG=1`. Fixes issue
  [#824](https://github.com/osohq/oso/issues/824)
- The ambiguous precedence error for Polar expressions like `x = 1 and y = 1 or y = 2`
  has been downgraded to a warning.

### Node.js

#### Other bugs & improvements

- Fixed an issue where the data filtering `Relation` class wasn't exported
  from the top-level package.
