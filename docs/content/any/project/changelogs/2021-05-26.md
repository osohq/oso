#### Removed unused parameter from `sqlalchemy_oso.roles.resource_role_class()` ([#925][])

The first positional parameter to `sqlalchemy_oso.roles.resource_role_class()`,
`declarative_base`, was no longer used and is now removed. To migrate existing
code that uses `sqlalchemy_oso.roles.resource_role_class()`, simply remove the
first parameter from the function invocation.

#### Option to enable baked queries for authorized sessions has been removed ([#879][])

In [release 0.6.2](project/changelogs/2021-05-17.md), we disabled [baked
queries][] by default because of the risk of unintentionally bypassing
authorization, but we allowed users who understood the risks to override that
default by passing `enable_baked_queries=True` to any of the authorized session
factories.

In this release, we've removed that escape hatch out of an abundance of caution.
Passing `enable_baked_queries=True` to any of the authorized session factories
will no longer have any effect. If you have a good reason for wanting to enable
baked queries on authorized sessions, please reach out on [Slack][]. We would
love to hear about it!

### New features

#### Support for SQLAlchemy 1.4 ([#879][])

The `sqlalchemy-oso` library now supports SQLAlchemy 1.4!

If you're already using `sqlalchemy-oso` with SQLAlchemy 1.3, upgrading to
SQLAlchemy 1.4 requires zero code changes (for `sqlalchemy-oso`, that is â€” you
might have to update some SQLAlchemy code).

There's a single (non-breaking) API change: `sqlalchemy_oso.register_models()`
now accepts either a [declarative base class][] (if you're using SQLAlchemy 1.3
or 1.4) or a [registry][] (if you're using 1.4).

If you run into any issues with SQLAlchemy 1.4, please don't hesitate to reach
out on [Slack][] or open [a new GitHub issue][].

Happy SQLAlchemy-ing!

### Other bugs & improvements

- Relaxed minimum SQLAlchemy 1.3 version to 1.3.17, when the
  `sqlalchemy.orm.relationship.sync_backref` flag was added. ([#879][])

## `sqlalchemy-oso-preview` 0.0.4

#### Resource Model Primary Key Requirements ([#909][])

All resource models used with roles must use the same type in the database for their primary id.

For example:

```py
class Organization(Base):
    __tablename__ = "organizations"

    id = Column(String(), primary_key=True)

class Repository(Base):
    __tablename__ = "repositories"

    id = Column(String(), primary_key=True)
    org_id = Column(String(), ForeignKey("organizations.id"), index=True)
    org = relationship("Organization")
```

Both Organization and Repository have their primary key column as type `String()` so this would work.
They could both be some other type such as `Integer()`
but you could not have one as `String()` and the other as `Integer()`.
