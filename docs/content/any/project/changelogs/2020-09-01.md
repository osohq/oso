  fixes, and more.

## `oso` 0.5.1

### Other bugs & improvements

* Fixed parsing of list match statements: `[1, 2, 3] matches [1, 2, 3]`.
* When an inline query fails, the query that failed is printed in the error
  message.
* Fixed a bug whereby running the Oso REPL from within a Node.js REPL session
  would result in duplicated STDIN and overlapping STDOUT streams.
* Make it possible to use expressions inside lists, e.g. `d = {x: 1} and [d.x]
  = [1]`.

### Community

Thank you to [Terry Appleby](https://github.com/tappleby) for finding the
above issue with expressions in lists.
