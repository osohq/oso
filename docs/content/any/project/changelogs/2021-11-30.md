## Oso 0.23.1

### Core

#### Other bugs & improvements

- Oso now allows multiple resource blocks to be declared for the same resource type. The declarations from all resource blocks for a given type are merged together before policy evaluation. This permits rules in one block to reference declarations in another and for resource blocks to be composed over multiple files.
- Fixed a data race in our error handling functionality which resulted in truncated error messages.
- Fixed a regression in the logic for rule matching when using `in` with data filtering.
- Fixed a regression in rule type checking which prevented using roles with `actor` blocks.

### Rust

#### Other bugs & improvements

- Implemented `ExternalIsSubclass` query event. Prevents `x matches Foo and x matches Bar`
  from panicking. Instead, this will now correctly fail when `Foo != Bar`.
  Thanks to [`@davepacheco`](https://github.com/davepacheco) for the contribution!


## `RELEASED_PACKAGE_1` NEW_VERSION


### Go

#### Other bugs & improvements
- Added a `SetAcceptExpression` method to the `Query` struct which makes
  it possible to get partially-evaluated terms back from the core.
  This is a step towards data filtering in Go.
  Thanks to [`@joshrotenberg`](https://github.com/joshrotenberg) for the PR!

#### Platform Support

We now support building Oso on ARM-based MacOS systems using Go 1.16 or later.
