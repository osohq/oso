## `oso` 0.2.0

### Breaking changes

{{% callout "Warning" "orange" %}}
  This release contains breaking changes. Be sure to follow migration steps
  before upgrading.
{{% /callout %}}

#### New rule syntax

We have made several major changes to Polar syntax used in writing rules to
make the policy more intuitive for non-technical policy readers.

* The **if** operator is now written as `if` instead of `:=`.
* The **and** operator is now written as `and` instead of `,`.
* The **or** operator is now written as `or` instead of `|`.
* The **not** operator is now written as `not` instead of `!`.

Taken together, these changes produce rules like:

```polar
allow(actor: User, "view", resource: Expense) if
    role(actor, "accountant") and
    actor.location = resource.location;
```

Instead of:

```polar
allow(actor: User, "view", resource: Expense) :=
    role(actor, "accountant"),
    actor.location = resource.location;
```

### New features

#### Class methods

Methods can now be called on application classes. For example, with a class
called `Foo`:

```polar
my_rule(x) if Foo.class_method(x) = true;
```

#### Rest operator for lists

Lists can now be destructured using the `\*rest` operator. This allows
statements like:

```polar
[x, *rest] = [1, 2, 3]
```

`x` would be assigned to `1`, and `rest` to `[2, 3]`.

More information here: [\*rest Operator](polar-syntax#rest-operator).

#### Language support for anonymous variables

A variable named `_` is now recognized as an anonymous variable. Previously,
multiple anonymous variables in a rule needed to be named distinctly (`_`,
`__`, `___`). This scenario is often encountered when writing rules with
specializers that do not use the argument value:

```polar
allow(_: User, "view", _: Resource);
```

#### Host language list, string, dictionary and number methods

Because your application objects probably use your languageâ€™s built-in
primitive types such as `str`, `dict`, and `int`, Polar allows you to use
methods on those types for its built-ins, too. That way you can use familiar
methods like `str.startswith()` on strings regardless of whether they
originated in your application or as a literal in your policy. This applies to
all of the Polar [primitive types](polar-syntax#primitive-types): strings, lists,
dictionaries, and numbers, in any supported application language.

More info: [Built-in Types](getting-started/policies#built-in-types).

#### Stack traces for runtime errors

Now errors occurring during execution of Polar code will include context about
where the issue occurred. The `stack_trace` property on exception types
contains a formatted traceback indicating where errors happened:

```console
trace (most recent evaluation last):
  in query at line 1, column 1
    allow(1)
  in rule allow at line 5, column 13 in file stack-trace.polar
    call_failing_rule(_x_18)
  in rule allow at line 5, column 13 in file stack-trace.polar
    call_failing_rule(_x_18)
  in rule call_failing_rule at line 3, column 25 in file stack-trace.polar
    failing_rule(_x_21)
  in rule call_failing_rule at line 3, column 25 in file stack-trace.polar
    failing_rule(_x_21)
  in rule failing_rule at line 1, column 20 in file stack-trace.polar
    _x_24 in 2
  in rule failing_rule at line 1, column 20 in file stack-trace.polar
    _x_24 in 2
```

#### Singleton variable warnings

The usage of a variable only once will now emit a warning on standard error.
These often indicate logical errors. This warning can be silenced by prefixing
a variable with an underscore. More information: [singleton
variables](polar-syntax#singletons).
