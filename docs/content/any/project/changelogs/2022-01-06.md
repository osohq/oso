## `oso` 0.25.1

### Core

#### Bug fixes & improvements

- Fixed a bug that caused `UnhandledPartial` errors in some valid
  policies that unified two variables that both have constraints.
- Added a new error `QueryForUndefinedRule` that will be raised at runtime if there are
  no definitions for a rule that is queried.
- `INFO` logging now emits "Applicable rules" for every rule that is called, rather
  than only the top level rule.
