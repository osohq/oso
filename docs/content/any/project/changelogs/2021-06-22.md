  Changelog for Release 2021-06-22 (oso 0.13.0, sqlalchemy-oso 0.9.0)
  containing new features, bug fixes, and more.
---

## `oso` 0.13.0

### Core

#### Breaking changes

Attempting to create a dictionary with a repeated key is now a parser error.
Previously, the first (key, value) pair would be taken and the others would be
dropped.

Before:

```polar
query> d = {a: 1, a: 2}
d = {'a': 1}
```

After:

```polar
query> d = {a: 1, a: 2}
ParserError
Duplicate key: a at line 1, column 6
```

#### Other bugs & improvements

Trailing commas are now supported in dictionaries and lists. For example:

```polar
allow(_user, action, repository: Repository) if
  action in [
    "read",
    "write",
  ];
```

### Node.js & Python

#### New features

##### Built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policy

<!-- TODO(gj): usual caveat about this being an experimental feature; talk to us
if you want to use it in prod. -->

<!-- TODO(gj): link to new docs -->

### Ruby

The `Query` object returned by `Polar::Polar#query` is now an `Enumerable`.
Previously, you would need to access the `results` attribute which was an
enumerator.

The main impact of this change is that queries are no longer run on a Fiber, and
therefore any methods using Fiber-local variables (e.g. `Thread.current[:var]`)
will work fine.

If you are only using `Oso#allowed?` there is no change needed.

Before:

```ruby
query = oso.query_rule('allow', actor, action, resource)
first = query.results.next
# raises StopIterator if no results
```

After:

```ruby
query = oso.query_rule('allow', actor, action, resource)
first = query.first
# first is nil if there are no results
```

#### Renamed `parent` and `user_in_role` predicates for Role-Based Access Control policies

Two built-in Polar predicates used for [implementing Role-Based Access
Control]({{< ref path="/new-roles/" lang="python" >}}) have been renamed for
clarity and consistency:

- The `parent(child, parent)` predicate has been renamed to
  `parent_child(parent, child)`.
- The `user_in_role(actor, role, resource)` predicate has been renamed to
  `actor_can_assume_role(actor, role, resource)`.
