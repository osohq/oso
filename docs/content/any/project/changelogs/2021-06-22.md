  containing new features, bug fixes, and more.

## `oso` 0.13.0

### Core

#### Breaking changes

Attempting to create a dictionary with a repeated key is now a parser error.
Previously, the first (key, value) pair would be taken and the others would be
dropped.

Before:

```polar
query> d = {a: 1, a: 2}
d = {'a': 1}
```

After:

```polar
query> d = {a: 1, a: 2}
ParserError
Duplicate key: a at line 1, column 6
```

#### Other bugs & improvements

Trailing commas are now supported in dictionaries and lists. For example:

```polar
allow(_user, action, repository: Repository) if
  action in [
    "read",
    "write",
  ];
```

### Node.js & Python

#### New features

##### Built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policy

Oso's Python and Node libraries now include [built-in support for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies](/guides/roles).
The goal of introducing this feature is to make setting up common role-based access control patterns even easier
by providing a structured configuration interface and implementing the query evaluation logic.

Here's an example policy using the new configuration interface:

```polar
resource(_type: Org, "org", actions, roles) if
    actions = ["read", "create_repo"] and
    roles = {
        member: {
            permissions: ["read"],
        },
        owner: {
            permissions: ["read", "create_repo"],
        }
    };
```

The configuration interface allows Oso users to:
- Define **resource types** and **roles** that are used to control access to individual resources of that type (resource-specific roles)
  - E.g., users can define `Organization` resources that have `"owner"`, `"member"`, and `"billing"` roles.
- Define the **actions** that each role allows users to take
  - E.g., the `Organization` `owner` role allows users to take the `invite_member` action
- Define parent-child relationships between resources to enable features like **implied roles and nested permissions**
  - E.g., if a user has the `"owner"` role on an organization, they also have the `"admin"` role implied for every child repository of the organization

In order to use the built-in policy, Oso users must store user-role assignments themselves and implement a simple interface to expose the user-role assignment data to Oso's policy engine.

Then, the role-based policy will be evaluated as any other policy would by calling the `is_allowed()` library method.

To get started, check out [the docs](/guides/roles).


<!-- TODO(gj): usual caveat about this being an experimental feature; talk to us
if you want to use it in prod. -->

### Ruby

#### Breaking changes

{{% callout "Warning" "orange" %}}
  This release contains breaking changes. Be sure to follow migration steps
  before upgrading.
{{% /callout %}}

The `Query` object returned by `Polar::Polar#query` is now an `Enumerable`.
Previously, you would need to access the `results` attribute which was an
enumerator.

The main impact of this change is that queries are no longer run on a Fiber, and
therefore any methods using Fiber-local variables (e.g. `Thread.current[:var]`)
will work fine.

If you are only using `Oso#allowed?` there is no change needed.

Before:

```ruby
query = oso.query_rule('allow', actor, action, resource)
first = query.results.next
# raises StopIterator if no results
```

After:

```ruby
query = oso.query_rule('allow', actor, action, resource)
first = query.first
# first is nil if there are no results
```

### Java

#### Other bugs & improvements

Thanks to the ever-helpful [`@joshrotenberg`](https://github.com/joshrotenberg)
for a pair of contributions:

- Making sure the `junit` dependency doesn't get packaged in our released JARs
  ([#964](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/964)).
- Starting to align the Java test suite with the other language test suites
  ([#967](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/967)).

#### Renamed `parent` and `user_in_role` predicates for Role-Based Access Control policies

Two built-in Polar predicates used for [implementing Role-Based Access
Control]({{< ref path="/new-roles/" lang="python" >}}) have been renamed for
clarity and consistency:

- The `parent(child, parent)` predicate has been renamed to
  `parent_child(parent, child)`.
- The `user_in_role(actor, role, resource)` predicate has been renamed to
  `actor_can_assume_role(actor, role, resource)`.
