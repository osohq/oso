## `oso` 0.7.1

### New features

#### Modulo and remainder operators

The new `mod` and `rem` arithmetic operators can calculate moduli and
remainders, respectively:

```
1 mod 3 == 1
1 rem 3 == 1
-1 mod 3 == 2
-1 rem 3 == -1
```

### Other bugs & improvements


* Improved Rust library API for converting between Oso Values and native Rust
types.


* More detailed error messages in the Rust library for type errors.


* The preview list filtering feature in `django-oso` now handles more policies
correctly, and consistently raises errors for policies that cannot yet be
converted to a Django Query filter.
