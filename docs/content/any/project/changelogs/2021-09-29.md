##### Undefined attributes now error

To help with catching erroneous policies, accessing an undefined attribute
on an object will now return an error.

Policy:

```polar
allow(user, "read", "document") if user.isAdmin;
```

Code:

```js
const user = {name: "notanadmin"};
await oso.isAllowed(user, "read", document);
```

Before this would silently fail, since `user.isAdmin = undefined` in JavaScript, and
not truthy.

Now, this will error since `isAdmin` is not a property on `user`.

This will still work (1) if `user = {isAdmin: undefined}`,
and (2) by instead using the policy

```polar
allow(user: {isAdmin: true}, "read", "document");
```
since specializers will not error if a field is missing.
