## `oso` 0.5.0

### Major news

#### Node.js support

Oso now supports applications written in Node.js, using our Node.js
library. Download here.

### Breaking changes

**WARNING**: This release contains breaking changes. Be sure
to follow migration steps before upgrading.

#### Method/Attribute syntax

Previously, `x.foo` and `x.foo()` in an Oso policy could either be
performing an attribute lookup or invoking a zero-arity method on `x`. If
looking up the `foo` property returned a method, the host language libraries
would transparently invoke it and return the result.

**As of this release, parentheses are required for invocation**. `x.foo`
performs a lookup, and `x.foo()` invokes a zero-arity method.

### New features

#### Debug Mode

Oso can be run in debug mode by setting an environment variable `POLAR_LOG=1`
This prints debug output when polar queries are evaluated to show whatâ€™s
happening.

### Other bugs & improvements


* Improved performance of policies with many rules having ground (constant)
parameters.


* Improved performance of `in` operator (list membership) with many ground
elements.


* Stack traces return the original policy source instead of the internal
version.


* New FFI methods for passing print and warning messages from the core runtime
to the language libraries.
