## `sqlalchemy-oso-preview` 0.0.2

### Python

#### Breaking changes

{{% callout "Warning" "orange" %}}
This release contains breaking changes. Be sure to follow migration steps
before upgrading.
{{% /callout %}}

##### Deprecated `set_get_session` method

`set_get_session` is no longer available, as this method was used for the previous version of roles support.

#### New features

##### `SQLAlchemyOso` object provides a unified interface for `Oso` and `OsoRoles`

The `SQLAlchemyOso` object is now available to simplify the initialization of Oso for SQLAlchemy.

Now, instead of the following:

```python
from oso import Oso
from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models
from sqlalchemy_oso.roles2 import OsoRoles
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()
oso = Oso()
register_models(oso, Base)
oso_roles = OsoRoles(oso, Base, User, sessionmaker)
```

both `Oso` and `OsoRoles` are wrapped by `SQLAlchemyOso`:

```python
from sqlalchemy_oso import SQLAlchemyOso
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()
oso = SQLAlchemyOso(Base)
oso.enable_roles(User, sessionmaker)
```

After calling `SQLAlchemyOso.enable_roles()`, the role management methods defined on `OsoRoles` are available on `SQLAlchemyOso`.

You can find an example in our [Getting Started guide]({{< ref path="/new-roles/getting-started" lang=python >}}).

##### `Roles.user_in_role` available from Polar policies

Oso-managed user-to-role assignments created through the [role-management API]({{< ref path="/new-roles/end_user_configuration" lang=python >}}) can now be accessed within Polar policies using `Roles.user_in_role(user, role, resource)`.

##### `assignments_for_user` returns all direct role assignments for a single user

`OsoRoles.assignments_for_user(user=my_user_object)` will return a list of the roles that `my_user_object` is directly assigned to.

`assignments_for_user` can be called on an instance of `OsoRoles` or an instance of `SQLAlchemyOso` after calling `SQLAlchemyOso.enable_roles()`.
