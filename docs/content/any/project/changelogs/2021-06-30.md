## `oso` 0.13.1

### Java

#### New features

##### `getAllowedActions`

The Java library now includes the `Oso.getAllowedActions` method.
`getAllowedActions` accepts an actor and a resource, and returns a set of all allowed actions (strings) on the resource.
Many thanks to [`@joshrotenberg`](https://github.com/joshrotenberg) for yet another great contribution!

See [Java API docs]({{< ref path="reference/api" lang="java" >}}).

### Core

#### Bugs & improvements

- Fixed validation bug in the Oso Roles feature that caused an error if an application method was called from inside the `actor_has_role_for_resource` Polar rule.
