## `oso` 0.1.0

### Major news

#### The Oso core is now written in Rust

This release consists of mostly internal changes. The core implementation of
the Polar language is now written in Rust.

#### New Python package

Precompiled wheels supporting Python >= 3.6 are now distributed through
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/oso/) with `pip install oso`.

#### Ruby support

The `oso-oso` gem supporting Ruby >= 2.4 is now available on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/oso-oso). Try it out with `gem install oso-oso`.

### Breaking changes

**WARNING**: This release contains breaking changes.

#### Polar language changes

##### Explicit class instantiation with the `new` operator

This release introduces the `new` operator. Previously, the literal value
`Foo{x: 1}` would be implicitly constructed as a `Foo` instance in some
cases. Instantiation is now explicit, and `Foo{x: 1}` is only valid as a
specializer:

```
check_this(foo: Foo{x: 1})
```

Constructing a new instance of `Foo` from Polar requires an explicit `new`
operator:

```
new Foo{x: 1}
```

#### API changes

##### Python

Disambiguated load functions. `oso.Oso.load` is no longer valid:


* Load files with `oso.Oso.load_file()`.


* Load strings with `oso.Oso.load_str()`.

### New features

#### New operators: `in` and `forall`

Documentation:


* `in`


* `forall`

### Other bugs & improvements


* More consistent formatting for error messages.


* Performance improvements to the Polar virtual machine that are especially
significant for policies with many rules.
