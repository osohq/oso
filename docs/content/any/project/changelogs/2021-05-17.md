## `sqlalchemy-oso` 0.6.2

### Other bugs & improvements

- Authorized sessions now disable [baked queries][] by default because the
  caching mechanism can bypass authorization by using queries from the cache
  that were previously baked without authorization applied. If you understand
  the risks and still want to opt-in to the previous behavior of using baked
  queries, you can pass the `enable_baked_queries=True` keyword argument to
  `sqlalchemy_oso.authorized_sessionmaker()` and friends.
