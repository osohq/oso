## `oso` 0.3.0

### Major news

#### Java support

Java packages for version >= 10 (Linux and macOS) are now published in our
[Maven Repository](https://github.com/osohq/oso/packages/321403).

### Breaking changes

**WARNING**: This release contains breaking changes. Be sure
to follow migration steps before upgrading.

#### `oso.query_predicate()` renamed in Oso libraries

To improve our API & better match documentation, `oso.query_predicate()` has
been renamed `oso.query_rule()`. The Python API now returns a generator
instead of a `QueryResult` object to improve consistency across libraries.

#### `allow()` method renamed in Oso libraries

To eliminate ambiguity, the `allow()` method of the Oso library has been
renamed to:


* `is_allowed()` in Python


* `#allowed?` in Ruby


* `isAllowed()` in Java

#### `print()` predicate in policies

You can now use the `print` predicate in a policy to print the values passed
in to stderr. `print` accepts any number of arguments, and will return the
values of variables.

#### `isa` operator replaced with `matches`

To improve readability of Polar policies, the `isa` operator has been
replaced with `matches` (Matches Operator). Any policies using the
`isa` operator will need to be migrated.

#### `cut()` predicate replaced with `cut` keyword

The Polar `cut` operator was previously parsed like a predicate, but it isnâ€™t
one. The new syntax (`cut`, without the empty parentheses) emphasizes its
role as an operator.

### New features

#### Basic Arithmetic

You can now evaluate basic arithmetic in your policies:

```
$ python -m oso
> x = 1 + 1
{'x': 2}
```

See Numbers for more.

#### Debugger

The Polar debugger will now display the host
language representation of class instances.

```
debug> bindings
_expense_1 = Expense(amount=500, description=coffee, submitted_by=alice@example.com)
```

#### Error Traces

Some runtime errors will now return a trace of the policy location where it
happened. For example:

```
irb(main):020:0> OSO.allowed?(actor: alice, action: "GET", resource: expense)
Oso::Polar::PolarRuntimeError: trace (most recent evaluation last):
      allow("alice@example.com", "GET", Expense(amount=500, description=coffee, submitted_by=alice@example.com))
  in rule allow at line 2, column 2 in file expenses.polar
    .(_expense_4, missing_attribute(), _value_1_5) and _value_1_5
  in rule allow at line 2, column 2 in file expenses.polar
    .(_expense_4, missing_attribute(), _value_1_5) and _value_1_5
  in rule allow at line 2, column 2 in file expenses.polar
    .(_expense_4, missing_attribute(), _value_1_5)
Application error: Oso::Polar::InvalidCallError at line 2, column 2 in file expenses.polar

    from irb:1:in `each'
    from irb:1:in `each'
    from irb:1:in `each'
```

### Other bugs & improvements


* Boolean values can now be queried directly. The statement `x = true and x`
now tests for the truthiness of `x` as the second argument of the
conjunction. Previously this would be invalid.


* Fixes for comparing numbers.


* Comparing a variable to itself no longer loops infinitely.


* Allow unbound variables to be returned from queries.


* Additional warnings for singletons.
