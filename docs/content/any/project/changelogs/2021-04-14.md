# `oso` 0.12.0

## Core (All libraries)

### Breaking Changes

{{% callout "Warning" "orange" %}}
  This release contains breaking changes. Be sure to follow migration steps
  before upgrading.
{{% /callout %}}

#### Unifying with a predicate now fails at parse time

Previously it was possible to bind predicates to variables, e.g. `p = f(x)`.
This supported an undocumented feature for unifying predicates,
e.g. `f(x) = f(1)` would unify `x = 1`.

To avoid confusion with querying rules, binding predicates
to variables is no longer legal in this release. For example:

```polar
f(x,y) if x < 3 and y = g(x);
```

will now fail at parse time.

A similar thing can be achieved by using lists.
Instead of `f(x) = f(1)`, you can write `["f", x] = ["f", 1]` if necessary.

#### Query for unbound variables

Querying for an unbound variable `x` is inferred to mean `x = true`.
This is consistent with the behavior for a bound variable, and makes it
possible to use this syntax with data filtering, i.e:

```polar
allow(_, _, resource) if
    resource.is_public;
```

Before: `f(x) if x;` would error if `x` was unbound.
Now: this is interpreted as `f(x) if x = true;`.

### Increased performance for data filtering

The performance of data filtering queries has been improved up to 3x
with queries involving larger policies seeing the greatest speed ups.
We continue to work on performance of data filtering queries
and Polar. We've added more benchmarks to our test suite to cover data
filtering queries. However, it's helpful to have real world examples
to base our performance work on. [Join our slack](https://join-slack.osohq.com)
to share your policies with us!

## Rust

### New features

#### `get_allowed_actions()` in Rust

Added support for `get_allowed_actions()`. You can use this method to
get all actions that an actor is allowed to perform on a resource.

```rust
// get a HashSet of actions as strings
let actions: HashSet<String> = oso.get_allowed_actions(actor, resource)?;

assert!(actions.contains("CREATE"));
```

Thanks to [@joshrotenberg](https://github.com/joshrotenberg) for adding this in [PR #789](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/789).

### Other bugs & improvements

- The Rust CLI now uses [`clap`](https://crates.io/crates/clap) to expose a
  prettier interface thanks to
  [@joshrotenberg](https://github.com/joshrotenberg) via [PR
  #828](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/828).
 - Added `FromPolar` and `ToPolar` implementations for more `std::collections` types.
  Thanks to [`@gjvnq`](https://github.com/gjvnq) for [PR #822](https://github.com/osohq/oso/pull/822)!

## Node.js

### Other bugs & improvements

- Added `free()` method to enable manually freeing the underlying Polar WASM
  instance. This should *not* be something you need to do during the course of
  regular usage. It's generally only useful for scenarios where large numbers
  of instances are spun up and not cleanly reaped by the GC, such as during a
  long-running test process in 'watch' mode.

- The Polar `Variable` type is now exposed in the Node.js library, allowing users to pass unbound variables to `queryRule()` and `isAllowed()`.

```js
const oso = new Oso();
await oso.loadStr('hello("world"); hello("something else");');
const query = oso.queryRule("hello", new Variable("var"));
for await (const result of query) {
  console.log(result);
}

=> Map(1) { 'var' => 'world' }
=> Map(1) { 'var' => 'something else' }
```

## Go

### Other bugs & improvements

- Go lib no longer tries to print the zero values it uses for bookkeeping. This
  would crash when running on macOS under delve.
- `RegisterClass()` and `RegisterClassWithName()` now accept an instance of the
  to-be-registered Go type instead of a `reflect.Type` instance:

  ```go
  // Previously supported & still works:
  oso.RegisterClass(reflect.TypeOf(Expense{}), nil)

  // Now supported:
  oso.RegisterClass(Expense{}, nil)
  ```
