## `oso` 0.7.0

### Breaking changes

**WARNING**: This release contains breaking changes. Be sure
to follow migration steps before upgrading.

#### `Oso.clear()` replaced with `Oso.clear_rules()`/`clearRules()`

The `Oso.clear()` method in Oso’s language libraries has been removed.
To clear rules from the Polar knowledge base, use the new `clear_rules()`
(or `clearRules()`) method, which clears rules but leaves registered classes
and constants in place.

To migrate, replace calls to `Oso.clear()` with either `Oso.clear_rules()` or
`Oso.clearRules()`, depending on the library you are using.
It is no longer necessary to re-register classes/constants after clearing.

#### Method signature for `Oso.register_constant()` updated

The parameters were swapped to mirror the signature of
`Oso.register_class()`.

#### Select Ruby methods now return `self` to enable method chaining


* `Oso#clear_rules`


* `Oso#load_file`


* `Oso#load_str`


* `Oso#register_class`


* `Oso#register_constant`

#### Custom constructors no longer supported in the Java, Python, or Ruby libraries

For the Java, Python, and Ruby libraries, custom constructors are a relic. They
were useful for translating keyword args into positional args before Oso
supported supplying positional args when constructing an instance via Polar’s
new operator. They were also useful for specifying a
`find_or_create`-style class method as a constructor, but that’s been
superseded by the introduction of calling methods directly on registered
constants, including classes.

To migrate, replace usage of a custom constructor with an equivalent class
method.

Note that custom constructors are still supported for the Rust library since
specifying a static `new` method for a type is nothing more than a
convention.

### New features

#### List filtering in `django-oso` (preview)

Oso can now respond to some queries with a set of constraints instead of a yes
or no decision.  In the `django-oso` library, the
`django_oso.auth.authorize_model()` function and
`django_oso.models.AuthorizedModel` class have been added to use this
functionality to authorize a **collection** of objects.  Instead of fetching
all objects and evaluating a query, the relevant authorization constraints will
be pushed down to the ORM and applied to a Django `QuerySet`.

This feature makes implementing list endpoints with authorization more
performant, since authorization does not need to be applied after fetching
data.

**This feature is currently in preview.**

### Other bugs & improvements


* Language libraries that haven’t yet implemented operations on application
instances (Java, Node.js, Ruby, Rust) now throw a uniform error type.

#### Improvements to the debugger


* Changes to the way stepping is implemented:

    
        * `step` steps by query instead of goal.


        * `over` and `out` are now implemented using a stack that tracks query
    parents.


* New `goal` command to step by goal (the way `step` used to work).


* New `stack` command to show all parent queries of the current one.


* `query n` command can take an integer argument `n` to inspect the query
at the nth level of the stack.
