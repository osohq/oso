## `oso` 0.14.2

### Core

#### Other bugs & improvements

- Constraints on unbound variables no longer prevent the variable from
  later being bound.

### Ruby

#### Other bugs & improvements

- The ruby host library now only calls `to_s` on external instances when the
  instance needs to be serialized for a log line, debug message, or error. This
  improves performance in cases where `to_s` is slow (i.e. requires a round-trip
  to the database).
