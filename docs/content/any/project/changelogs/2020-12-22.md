#### Updates to built-in roles

This release makes a number of changes to how the out-of-the-box role support
works in the `sqlalchemy_oso.roles` module. It simplifies the schema
of the role model, adds relationships to the user and resource classes, and
contains more error checks for various required constraints and things that can
go wrong.

### Bug fixes & improvements

* The `sqlalchemy-oso` library now supports authorization for queries that
  contain aliases.
