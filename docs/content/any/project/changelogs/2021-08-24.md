## `oso` 0.20.0-beta

### Core

#### Breaking changes

{{% callout "Warning" "orange" %}}
  This release contains breaking changes. Be sure to follow migration steps
  before upgrading.
{{% /callout %}}

##### `or` / `and` operator precedence

The `or` operator has had its precedence lowered to be consistent with other
programming languages. Existing policies using `or` should be updated where
necessary to group `or` operations using parentheses:

```polar
foo(a, b, c) if a and b or c;
```

would now be written

```polar
foo(a, b, c) if a and (b or c);
```

We have temporarily made policies which combine `and` and `or` _without_
using parentheses throw errors in order to avoid silent changes.
To silence the error, add parentheses.

#### New features

##### Data Filtering

This release makes data filtering a core library feature. We have added a new method `get_allowed_resources(actor, action, class)` that returns all the resources of type `class` that the actor is allowed to do the action on. It requires registering some new information about classes and implementing some hooks to do the filtering. In this preview it is available for Python, Ruby and JavaScript.
You can go to the [data filtering guide](https://docs.osohq.com/guides/data_filtering.html) to see how to use it.

##### Syntactic sugar for RBAC/ReBAC policies

This release introduces a new, shorthand syntax for declaring roles,
permissions, relations, and rules for a particular resource:

```polar
resource Repo {
  roles = ["reader", "writer"];
  permissions = ["pull", "push"];
  relations = { creator: User };

  "writer" if "creator";
  "reader" if "writer";

  "push" if "writer";
  "pull" if "reader";
}
```

Each of the shorthand rules is expanded into a full Polar rule. For example,
`"push" if "writer";` expands into the following rule:

```polar
has_permission(actor, "push", repo: Repo) if
  has_role(actor, "writer", repo);
```

And `"reader" if "writer";` expands to:

```polar
has_role(actor, "reader", repo: Repo) if
  has_role(actor, "writer", repo);
```

Documentation for the new syntax is forthcoming. In the meantime, if you have
any feedback we would love to hear it on [Slack][]!

#### Other bugs & improvements

- The debugger can now break on rule matches.
- Polar reserved words (e.g. `type`, `if`, `debug`) can be used as field and method names in
  dictionaries and objects.
- Fixed a bug where unifying an external instance with a partially-bound
  variable in the head of a rule would add an additional constraint to the
  variable instead of rebinding it to the external instance.

### Python

#### New Preview API: Enforcers

This release adds the `Enforcer` class to the `oso` python library, which is
intended to bridge the gap between your app and your policy. Instead of
querying your policy using `is_allowed`, an enforcer exposes the following
methods for more specific scenarios:

- `authorize(actor, action, resource)`: ensures an actor can perform a
  particular action on a resource (this is most similar to `is_allowed`).
- `authorize_request(actor, request)`: ensures an actor can send a particular
  request to the server.
- `authorize_field(actor, action, resource, field)`: ensures that an actor can
  perform an action on a particular field of a resource.

Read more about enforcers in the new [enforcement guide]({{< ref path="/guides/enforcement" lang=python >}}).
