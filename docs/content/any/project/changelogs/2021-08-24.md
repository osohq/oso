## `oso` 0.20.0-beta

### Core

#### Breaking changes

{{% callout "Warning" "orange" %}}
  This release contains breaking changes. Be sure to follow migration steps
  before upgrading.
{{% /callout %}}

The `or` operator has had its precedence lowered to be consistent with other
programming languages. Existing policies using `or` should be updated where
necessary to group `or` operations using parentheses:

```polar
foo(a, b, c) if a and b or c;
```

would now be written

```polar
foo(a, b, c) if a and (b or c);
```

We have temporarily made policies which combine `and` and `or` _without_
using parentheses throw errors in order to avoid silent changes.
To silence the error, add parentheses.

## `oso` 0.20.0-beta

### Core

#### Other bugs & improvements

- The debugger can now break on rule matches.
- Polar reserved words (e.g. `type`, `if`, `debug`) can be used as field and method names in
  dictionaries and objects.

### Python

#### New Preview API: Enforcers

This release adds the `Enforcer` class to the `oso` python library, which is
intended to bridge the gap between your app and your policy. Instead of
querying your policy using `is_allowed`, an enforcer exposes the following
methods for more specific scenarios:

- `authorize(actor, action, resource)`: ensures an actor can perform a
  particular action on a resource (this is most similar to `is_allowed`).
- `authorize_request(actor, request)`: ensures an actor can send a particular
  request to the server.
- `authorize_field(actor, action, resource, field)`: ensures that an actor can
  perform an action on a particular field of a resource.

Read more about enforcers in the new [enforcement guide](/python/guides/enforcement.html).
