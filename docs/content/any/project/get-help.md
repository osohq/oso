# Get Help

The Oso engineering team is available to help you as you build out authorization:

- Guidance on authorization best practices
- Answering questions on how to use Oso
- Authorization model and design reviews

We're available in [Slack](https://join-slack.osohq.com/), along with hundreds of other developers working on
authorization. You can also [set up a 1x1 with an Oso engineer](https://calendly.com/osohq/1-on-1).

For customers who want an SLA on support, we provide paid support. This includes:

- Production support (24x7x365)
- Emergency hotfixes
- Security reviews
- Production readiness preparation
