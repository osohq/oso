# Authorize Across Services

If you're performing authorization in multiple services, you'll need a way to share
authorization data (like roles or resource groups) between your applications.
Oso's authorization-as-a-service product, called [Oso Cloud](https://www.osohq.com/docs/), lets you store
authorization data and perform authorization from any of your applications. Like
the Oso Library, Oso Cloud is powered by [the Polar language](https://www.osohq.com/docs/reference/polar-syntax).
