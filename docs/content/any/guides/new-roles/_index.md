# Build Role-Based Access Control (30 min)

When managing access to resources within an application, it can be
useful to group permissions into **roles**, and assign these roles to
users. This is known as **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).** The Oso
Roles library provides a configuration-based approach to adding
role-based access control to your application.

The roles library includes:

- **Role configuration** - Declarative configuration for roles and
  permissions for each resource. The roles configuration supports
  multi-tenancy, resource-specific roles, and hierarchical roles. Groups
  and custom roles are coming soon.
- **Data management** - Manage user role assignments in your database,
  linking with your resource data.
- **Enforcement** - Enforce authorization consistently throughout your
  application routing and data access layers.
- **End-user configuration** - Expose authorization configuration to
  end users using Oso's role data API.
- **Last-mile customizations** - Extend authorization logic for each resource
  by writing custom policies using Polar, Oso's declarative policy
  language.
