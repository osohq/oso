# Filter Data

When you call `authorize(actor, action, resource)` , Oso evaluates the allow
rule(s) you have defined in your policy to determine if `actor` is allowed
to perform `action` on `resource`.  For example, if `jane` wants to `"edit"`
a `document`, Oso may check that `jane = document.owner`.  But what if you
need the set of all documents that Jane is allowed to edit?  For example, you
may want to render them as a list in your application.

One way to answer this question is to take every document in the system and
call `is_allowed` on it. This isn’t efficient and many times is just
impossible. There could be thousands of documents in a database but only three
that have the owner `"steve"`. Instead of fetching every document and passing
it into Oso, it's better to ask the database for only the documents that
have the owner `"steve"`. Using Oso to filter the data in your data
store based on the logic in your policy is what we call “Data Filtering”.

You can use data filtering to enforce authorization on queries made to your data
store. Oso will take the logic in the policy and turn it into a query for the
authorized data. Examples could include an ORM filter object, an HTTP request or
an elastic-search query. The query object and the way the logic maps to a query
are both user defined.

Data filtering is initiated through two methods on `Oso`.

`{{% exampleGet "authorizedResources" %}}` returns a list of all the
resources a user is allowed to do an action on. The results of a built and
executed query.

`{{% exampleGet "authorizedQuery" %}}` returns the query object itself.
This lets you add additional filters or sorts or any other data to it before
executing it.

The mapping from polar to a query is defined by an `Adapter`. If an adapter exists for your ORM or database you can use it, otherwise you may have to implement your own.

## Implementing an Adapter

### Adapters

An adapter is an interface that defines two methods.

#### Build a Query

`{{% exampleGet "buildQuery" %}}` takes some type information and an oso `Filter` object and returns a `Query`.

A `Filter` is a representation of a query. It is very similar to a SQL query.
It has three fields

- `root` Is the type we are filtering.
- `relations` Are the related types, typically turned into joins.
- `conditions` Are the individual pieces of logic that must be true. These typically get
turned into where clauses.

#### Execute a Query

`{{% exampleGet "executeQuery" %}}` takes a query and returns a list of the results.

You define the adapter to use with `{{% exampleGet "setDataFilteringAdapter" %}}`.

### Fields

The other thing you have to provide to use data filtering is type information
for registered classes. This lets Oso know what the types of an object's fields
are. Oso needs this information to handle specializers and other things in the
policy when we don't have a concrete resource. The fields are a 
{{% exampleGet "map" %}} from field name to type.

## Relations

Often you need data that is not contained on the object to make
authorization decisions. This comes up when the role required to
do something is implied by a role on it's parent object. For instance,
you want to check the organization for a repository but that data isn't
embedded on the repository object. You can add a `Relation` type to the type
definition that states how the other resource is related to this one. Then
you can access this field in the policy like any other field and it will
fetch the data when it needs it (via the query functions).

`Relation`s are a special type that tells Oso how one Class is related to
another. They specify what the related type is and how it's related.

- `kind` is either "one" or "many". "one" means there is one related object and
      "many" means there is a list of related objects.
- `other_type` is the class of the related objects.
- `my_field` Is the field on this object that matches `other_field`.
- `other_field` Is the field on the other object that matches `this_field`.

The `my_field` / `other_field` relationship is similar to a foreign key. It lets Oso
know what fields to match up with building a query for the other type.

## Example

{{< literalInclude
      dynPath="exampleBPath"
      from="docs: begin-b1"
      to="docs: end-b1"
      fallback="no" >}}

{{< literalInclude
      dynPath="exampleBPath"
      from="docs: begin-b2"
      to="docs: end-b2"
      fallback="no" >}}

{{< literalInclude
      dynPath="policyBPath"
      fallback="no" >}}

{{< literalInclude
      dynPath="exampleBPath"
      from="docs: begin-b3"
      to="docs: end-b3"
      fallback="no" >}}

## Evaluation
When Oso is evaluating data filtering methods it uses the adapter to build queries
and execute them.

Relation fields also work when you are not using data filtering methods are also
use the adapter to query for the related resources when you access them.


## Limitations

There are a few limitations to what you can do while using data filtering. You
can not call any methods on the passed in resource and you can not pass the
resource as an argument to any methods. Many cases where you would want to do
this are better handled by Relation fields.

Some Polar expressions are not supported. `not`, `cut` and `forall` are not
allowed in policies that want to use data filtering. Numeric comparisons with
the `<` `>` `<=` and `>=` are not currently supported either.

The new data filtering backend doesn't support queries where a given resource occurs more than once, so direct or indirect relations from a type to itself are currently unsupported. This limitation will be removed in an upcoming release.
