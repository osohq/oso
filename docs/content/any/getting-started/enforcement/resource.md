# Resource-level Enforcement

Is the current user allowed to perform a certain action on a certain resource?
This is the central question of **"resource-level" enforcement.**

Resource-level enforcement is the bread-and-butter of application authorization.
If you only perform one type of authorization in your app, it should be
this. **Just about every endpoint in your application should perform some kind
of resource-level enforcement.**

The method you use for resource-level authorization is called `authorize`, and
is exposed by an Oso enforcer. The `authorize` method takes three arguments,
`user`, `action`, and `resource`. It doesn't return anything, but potentially
throws an error. To handle this error, see [Authorization
Failure](#authorization-failure).

<!-- You'll see this method in a lot of our guides and examples, because it's the
simplest way to use Oso in your app. -->

```python
oso.authorize(user, "approve", expense)
```

The `authorize` method checks all of the `allow` rules in your policy, and
ensures that there is an `allow` rule for that applies to the given user,
action, and resource:

```polar
allow(user: User, "approve", expense: Expense) if
    expense.org = org and
    user.has_org_role(org, "admin");
```

Let's see an example of `authorize` from within an endpoint:

```python
def get_expense(user, expense_id):
    expense = db.fetch(
        "SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE id = %", expense_id)
    oso.authorize(user, "read", expense)

    # ... process request
```

As you can see from this example, it's common to have to fetch _some_ data
before performing authorization. To perform resource-level authorization, you
normally need to have the resource loaded!

## Authorization Failure

What happens when the authorization fails? That is, what if there is not an
`allow` rule that gives the user permission to perform the action on the
resource? In that case, the `authorize` method will raise an
`AuthorizationError`. There are actually two types of authorization errors,
depending on the situation.

- `NotFound` errors are for situations where the user should not even know
  that a particular resource _exists_. That is, the user does not have
  `"read"` permission on the resource. **You should handle these errors by
  showing the user a 404 "Not Found" error**.
- `Forbidden` errors are raised when the user knows that a resource exists
  (i.e. when they have permission to `"read"` the resource), but they are not
  allowed to perform the given action. **You should handle these errors by
  showing the user a 403 "Forbidden" error.**

{{% minicallout %}}
**Note**: a call to `authorize` with a `"read"` action will never raise a
`Forbidden` error, only `NotFound` errorsâ€”if the user is not allowed to read
the resource, the server should act as though it doesn't exist.

You could handle these errors at each place you call `authorize`, but that would
mean a lot of error handling. We recommend handling `NotFound` and `Forbidden`
errors globally in your application, using middleware or something similar.
Ideally, you can perform resource-level authorization by adding a single line of
code to each endpoint.

As an example, here's what a global error handler looks like in a flask app:

```python
from oso import ForbiddenError, NotFoundError

app = Flask()

@app.errorhandler(ForbiddenError)
def handle_forbidden(*_):
    return {"message": "Forbidden"}, 403

@app.errorhandler(NotFoundError)
def handle_not_found(*_):
    return {"message": "Not Found"}, 404
```

Then, when your application calls `oso.authorize(user, action, resource)`, it
will know how to handle errors that arise.
