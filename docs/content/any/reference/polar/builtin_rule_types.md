# Built-in Rule Types

Certain rules have special behavior in Oso. Built-in [rule types](reference/polar/polar-syntax#rule-types) define the expected arguments for special rules so that validation can be performed at policy load-time.

The following rule types will be checked every time a policy is loaded:

## `has_permission`

```polar
type has_permission(actor: Actor, permission: String, resource: Resource);
type has_permission(actor: Actor, permission: String, resource: Actor);
```
`has_permission` rules grant permissions on resources to actors. These rules are also generated by [shorthand rules](reference/polar/polar-syntax#shorthand-rules). The first argument must be an `Actor` type and third argument must be either a `Resource` or an `Actor` type defined using [actor and resource blocks](reference/polar/polar-syntax#actor-and-resource-blocks). The second argument must be a String, and should be a [declared permission](reference/polar/polar-syntax#permission-declarations) inside a block for the `resource` argument type.

## `has_role`

```polar
type has_role(actor: Actor, role: String, resource: Resource);
type has_role(actor: Actor, role: String, resource: Actor);
```

`has_role` rules grant roles on resources to actors. These rules are also generated by [shorthand rules](reference/polar/polar-syntax#shorthand-rules). The first argument must be an `Actor` type and third argument must be either a `Resource` or an `Actor` type defined using [actor and resource blocks](reference/polar/polar-syntax#actor-and-resource-blocks). The second argument must be a String, and should be a [declared role](reference/polar/polar-syntax#role-declarations) inside a block for the `resource` argument type.


## `has_relation`

<!-- // TODO: revisit this when working on extension guides. This rule currently lets users define any relation they would like, but we may want to restrict that a bit more. -->
```polar
type has_relation(subject: Resource, relation: String, object: Resource);
type has_relation(subject: Resource, relation: String, object: Actor);
type has_relation(subject: Actor, relation: String, object: Actor);
type has_relation(subject: Actor, relation: String, object: Resource);
```

`has_relation` rules are used to look up relations between application objects. The first and third arguments can be any combination of `Resource` and `Actor` types defined using [actor and resource blocks](reference/polar/polar-syntax#actor-and-resource-blocks). The second argument must be a String, and should be a [declared relation](reference/polar/polar-syntax#relation-declarations) inside the block for the `object` argument type.


## `allow`

```polar
type allow(actor, action, resource);
```

`allow` rules are the top-level entrypoint for policy evaluation. These rules are queried by calling `is_allowed()` and `authorize()` and `authorized_resources()`. This type of rule must have 3 arguments.

## `allow_field`

```polar
type allow_field(actor, action, resource, field);
```

`allow_field` rules are similar to `allow` rules, but they include the field that is being accessed on the resource.
These rules are queried by calling `authorize_field()` and `authorized_fields()`. This type of rule must have 4 arguments.

## `allow_request`

```polar
type allow_request(actor, request);
```

`allow_request` rules are similar to `allow` rules, but instead of authorizing an action and a resource, they authorize access to a request. These rules are queried by calling `authorize_request()`.
This type of rule must have 2 arguments.
