{{% coming_soon %}}

In the meantime, the [Oso Quickstart](quickstart) guide for Rust may be
useful if you're using the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) framework. If you're
using another Rust framework and would like to see or contribute support
for it, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/osohq/oso/issues)
or [join our Slack](https://join-slack.osohq.com/) to let us know!
