Welcome to the oso documentation!
==================================

.. todo::
    "what is oso" wording 

.. admonition:: What is oso?

    oso is a library for adding authorization to applications using a declarative
    policy language

The core use case of oso is to add authorization logic to any application.
This is commonly solved by custom logic sprinkled ad-hoc throughout an application,
leading to code that is hard to maintain, modify, and debug.

By using oso, you can:

1. Separate authorization code from business logic
2. Concisely express policies with a declarative language
3. Interact directly with your application data

To see this in action, :doc:`continue on to the Getting Started guide <getting-started>`.

To learn more about oso and the principles behind its design, 
:doc:`read the oso overview page <oso-overview>`.
