**Release date:** 2020-06-30


Major news
==========

oso now written in Rust
------------------------

This release has mostly internal changes. The core implementation
of the Polar language is now written in Rust.

Python + Ruby support
----------------------

Currently Python >=3.6 and Ruby >= 2.4 are supported:

- Precompiled wheels for python are now distributed through `pypi.org <https://pypi.org/project/oso/>`_. with ``pip install oso``
- Ruby gems with precompiled native extensions are available from `rubygems.org <https://rubygems.org/gems/oso-oso>`_ with ``gem install oso-oso``.



Breaking changes
================

.. warning:: This release contains breaking changes.

Explicit class instantiation
----------------------------

This release introduces the ``new`` operator. Previously, the literal value ``Foo{x: 1}`` would be implicitly be converted
to a instantiated ``Foo`` instance in some places. This is now explicit.
``Foo{x: 1}`` is only valid as a specializer, e.g.

.. code-block:: polar

  check_this(foo: Foo{x: 1})

whereas to construct a new instance of `Foo` from Polar, you use the syntax

.. code-block:: polar

  new Foo{x: 1}


API changes
-----------

Disambiguated load functions. `load` is no longer valid:
- Load files using `oso.Oso.load_file`
- Load strings using `oso.Oso.load_str`


New features
==============

New operators: ``in``, ``forall``, ``isa``
