Breaking changes
================

Bug fix for rest vars. @TODO

Anonymous rest variables now properly anonymized
------------------------------------------------

Previously, we were not generating unique identifiers for anonymous rest
variables (``*_``) during the rewriting pass. This resulted in unexpected
results for queries containing multiple anonymous rest variables, such as:

.. code-block:: polar

  [*_] in [*a] and [*b] in [*_] and b = 1

The above query would return a result with ``a`` bound to ``[1]`` because
``*a`` and ``*b`` interacted through the pair of un-anonymized rest variables.
After this change, that query now correctly returns a result with ``a`` bound
to ``[*_1]``, where ``*_1`` is the rewritten, anonymized rest variable.

New features
============

``get_allowed_actions`` introduced for Python
---------------------------------------------

Use :py:meth:`Oso.get_allowed_actions` to get a list of actions that a user
is allowed to take on a resource. These actions can be used for making
additional authorization decisions, especially in the frontend (e.g., hiding
or showing a button based on the current user's allowed actions).

See our guide :doc:`here <https://docs.oso.dev/getting-started/ui/index.html>`!

``PolarClass`` implemented for versions 0.7 & 0.8 of the ``uuid`` crate
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

``PolarClass`` is now implemented for versions 0.7 & 0.8 of the ``uuid`` crate
behind the optional ``uuid-07`` feature flag.

Ruby library now supports Ruby 3.0
----------------------------------

There are no breaking changes. Happy Rubying!

Running oso in the browser
--------------------------

The oso JavaScript/TypeScript package on NPM has been updated to work with
browser environments using bundlers like webpack.

Stay tuned for more information on how to use oso in the browser!
