New features
============

``PolarClass`` implemented for ``uuid`` crate
---------------------------------------------

``PolarClass`` is now implemented for `version 0.6 of the uuid crate
<https://docs.rs/uuid/0.6/uuid/>`_ behind the optional ``uuid-06`` feature
flag. Version 0.6 was chosen for compatibility with `Diesel
<https://crates.io/crates/diesel>`_.
