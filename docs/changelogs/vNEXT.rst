Updated to built-in roles in ``sqlalchemy-oso``
--------------------------------------------------------

This release makes a number of changes to how the out-of-the-box role support
works in the ``sqlalchemy-oso`` integration. It simplifies the schema of the role
model, adds relationships to the user and resource classes and contains more error checks
for various required constraints and things that can go wrong.

It also includes docs!
