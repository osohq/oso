Updates to built-in roles
-------------------------

This release makes a number of changes to how the out-of-the-box role support
works in the :py:data:`sqlalchemy_oso.roles` module. It simplifies the schema
of the role model, adds relationships to the user and resource classes, and
contains more error checks for various required constraints and things that can
go wrong.

It also includes :doc:`docs </getting-started/roles/index>`!

  contain aliases.
