New features
============

Modulo and remainder operators
------------------------------

The new ``mod`` and ``rem`` arithmetic operators can calculate moduli and
remainders, respectively:

.. code-block:: polar

  1 mod 3 == 1
  1 rem 3 == 1
  -1 mod 3 == 2
  -1 rem 3 == -1

Other bugs & improvements
=========================

- Improved Rust library API for converting between oso Values and native Rust
  types.
- More detailed error messages in the Rust library for type errors.
- The preview list filtering feature in ``django-oso`` now handles more policies
  correctly, and consistently raises errors for policies that cannot yet be
  converted to a Django Query filter.
