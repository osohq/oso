New features
============

Updated list filtering capabilities of the Django adapter
---------------------------------------------------------

More policies and Polar operations can now be used in the context of list
filtering. In particular, the ``in`` and ``matches`` operators (including
specializers in rule heads and embedded fields) now work in more cases,
as do nested lookups and comparison operators. The list filtering feature
remains in preview; we would love to hear feedback if you're trying to use
it in your application.

Install the latest version from pip: ``pip install django-oso``.

Check out `the documentation <TODO>`_.

SQLAlchemy adapter for list filtering
-------------------------------------

We've added our second list filtering adapter: SQLAlchemy! It is
roughly at feature parity with the Django adapter.

Try it out: ``pip install sqlalchemy-oso``.

Check out `the documentation <TODO>`_.

Other bugs & improvements
=========================

- Added `a new RBAC guide <https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/rbac.html>`_.
- Updated a few runtime error messages.
- New `documentation for the experimental list filtering feature <TODO>`_.
