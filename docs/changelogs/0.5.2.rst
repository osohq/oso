New features
==============

Support for constructors with both positional and keyword arguments
===================================================================

- In languages that support both positional and keyword args (currently Python and Ruby), oso now supports registering classes with constructors that use both.
- The syntax for calling a constructor with mixed args from an oso policy is::

    instance = new MyClass(1, 2, foo: 3)

- As is the convention in Python and Ruby, positional arguments must come before keyword arguments.
- See :ref:`operator-new`
