New features
============

Support for constructors with both positional and keyword arguments
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- In languages that support both positional and keyword arguments (currently Python and Ruby), oso now supports registering classes with constructors that use both.
- The syntax for calling a constructor with mixed arguments from an oso policy is::

    instance = new MyClass(1, 2, foo: 3)

- As is the convention in Python and Ruby, positional arguments must come before keyword arguments.
- See :ref:`operator-new`

Other bugs & improvements
=========================

- The Node.js library will now throw an ``InvalidConstructorError`` when
  attempting to register a non-constructable object via ``registerClass``.
- Rule indexing performance improvements.
- Standardize handling of ±∞ and NaN across all language libraries.
