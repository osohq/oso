**Release date:** 2020-09-01


Other bugs & improvements
=========================

- Fixed parsing of list match statements: ``[1, 2, 3] matches [1, 2, 3]``.
- When an inline query fails, the query that failed is printed in the error
  message.
- Fixed a bug whereby running the oso REPL from within a Node.js REPL session
  would result in duplicated STDIN and overlapping STDOUT streams.
- Make it possible to use expressions inside lists, e.g. ``d = {x: 1} and [d.x] = [1]``.

Thank you to `Terry Appleby <https://github.com/tappleby>`_ for finding the
above issue with expressions in lists.
