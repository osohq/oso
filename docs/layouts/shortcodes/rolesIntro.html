<h1>Oso Roles Library</h1>

{{ if eq (.Get "cannotUse") true }}
<p>The Oso roles library provides a configuration-based approach to adding role-based access control
    to your application. The library is in early access.</p>

<p>Right now, the library is only compatible with SQLAlchemy and generally cannot be used with
    {{ .Get "framework" }} based apps. Check out our <a href="{{ ref . "learn/roles" }}">roles
        modeling guide</a> to see how to model roles yourself in Polar, or <a
        href="http://join-slack.osohq.com">join our Slack</a> to chat
    with our team about implementing roles.

<p>If you are using {{ .Get "framework" }} with SQLAlchemy, the roles library is already compatible!
Our example application (GitClub) uses Flask, but the same concepts apply. For some pointers on
using Oso Roles with {{ .Get "framework" }},

    The following guides show how to use the library to add roles to a {{ .Get "framework" }} app
    with GitClub, our best practice example app. The roles library is compatible with the SQLAlchemy
    ORM.</p>
