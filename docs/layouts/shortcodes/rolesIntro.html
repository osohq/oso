<p>The Oso roles library provides a configuration-based approach to adding role-based access control
    to your application. The library is in early access.</p>

<p>Right now, the library is only compatible with SQLAlchemy and generally cannot be used with
    {{ .Get "framework" }} based apps. To get help with roles in your app now or to let us know how badly you want an Oso Roles
        library in {{ .Get "framework" }}, <a href="http://join-slack.osohq.com">drop into our Slack</a>
        or <a href="mailto:engineering@osohq.com?subject=Roles%20for%20{{ .Get "framework" }}">send an email to our engineering team</a>.

<p>The Oso roles library provides a configuration-based approach to adding role-based access control
    to your application. The library is in early access.</p>

<p>If you are using {{ .Get "framework" }} with SQLAlchemy, the roles library is already compatible!
Our example application (<a href="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react">GitClub</a>) uses Flask, but the same concepts apply. For some pointers on
using Oso Roles with {{ .Get "framework" }} or if you find yourself getting stuck, <a href="http://join-slack.osohq.com">drop into our Slack</a>
or <a href="mailto:engineering@osohq.com?subject=Help%20with%20roles">send an email to our engineering team</a> and we'll unblock you.

    The following guides show how to use the library to add roles to a {{ .Get "framework" }} app
    with <a href="https://github.com/osohq/gitclub-sqlalchemy-flask-react">GitClub</a>, our best practice example app. The roles library is compatible with the SQLAlchemy
    ORM.</p>
